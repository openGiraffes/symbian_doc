architecture. ScreenPlay is a new graphics architecture, introduced
in Symbian^3 (S^3). ScreenPlay enables device creators to take advantage
of improved software performance, hardware acceleration and third
party graphics engines. ScreenPlay is sometimes known as the <strong>New
Graphics Architecture (NGA)</strong>. </p>
<p>ScreenPlay is a response to new requirements and developments in
device hardware models. For example, ScreenPlay can support graphics
accelerators and graphics processing units (GPUs) and non-uniform
memory models as well as uniform memory models. A non-uniform memory
model is an architecture in which a GPU has a completely different
processing area from the CPU such that the GPU memory is not available
to the CPU and vice versa. ScreenPlay can handle non-uniform memory
models without the need to copy buffers between the different processing
areas. </p>

<div id="GUID-D8BB0841-1E27-45A0-99AF-0F0A2D0A7362"><h3 class="section-title">Architecture</h3> <p>The following diagram shows the key components in the Symbian
Graphics package and some closely related components in other packages. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-3300E986-4B93-5122-88C4-D7CC231F3BA3"><img src="GUID-DD22D66C-C303-5432-9C24-71F26190FCA0_d0e246338_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>             Symbian^3 component architecture            </p></div> <p>The key ScreenPlay components are introduced below under
separate subheadings. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-AB1E3E20-01A9-4090-A404-0D1FF978AF53"><h3 class="section-title">Graphics
Composition </h3><p>The composition engine composes content, possibly
from several different sources, before it is displayed on the screen.
Composition involves the important concepts of scene elements (or
layers) and surfaces. Scene elements describe the geometric position,
size and orientation of items to be displayed on the screen; whereas
surfaces are pixel buffers for holding an image or part of a scene. </p> <p>The composition engine maintains the stack of scene elements
and computes what is visible. For example, it culls invisible areas
and maintains a list of dirty rectangles. It blends the pixels if
necessary and can perform limited transformations, such as scaling
and rotation (in 90Â° increments). The composition engine is an <strong>adaptation component</strong>, which means that device creators can adapt
or replace it to suit the exact hardware on the device. The composition
engine can utilize GPU hardware composition and LCD hardware rotation
if they are available. </p> <p>The composition components are specific
to ScreenPlay. For more information, see <a href="GUID-859CAA08-59C9-5FD3-98DE-6BDD0D6ED50B.html">Graphics Composition</a>. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-04973DCA-9DCA-40E8-AC4D-5FB244F23293"><h3 class="section-title">Surface
Manager and Surface Update Server</h3><p>The Surface Manager component
creates and manages graphics composition surfaces. The Surface Manager
reference implementation implements surfaces as shared chunks because
they must be accessible by user-side processes and the kernel and
composition hardware. Surfaces can be multi-buffered and are identified
by a 128 bit identifier (called the surface ID). This gets resolved
to an actual memory address by calling the Surface Manager Map Surface
API. Surfaces can be used by other Symbian components such as the <a href="GUID-DDE1A8A9-1D67-53BF-8A65-340F139AD4AB.html">Multimedia Framework
(MMF)</a>  and by applications such as OpenGL ES games. The Surface Manager
is an adaptation component and so can be adapted or replaced to suit
the hardware. </p><p>The Surface Update component provides
a communication mechanism between the composition engine and clients.
This is particularly useful for clients (such as video) that produce
fast updates and use multi-buffered surfaces. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-92C609E2-EF56-460E-B4BD-B935AB8ECFFB"><h3 class="section-title">Window
Server</h3><p>The Window Server has been extended with a render
stage framework, which enables the last stage of the Window Server
rendering to be customizable through render stage plug-ins. This process,
known as "deferred rendering" is achieved by intercepting the output
of the Window Server and then deciding how that output should be rendered.
For example, the output can be hardware accelerated or it can be sent
to a third party graphics engine. The render stage framework enables
device creators to integrate different UIs and runtime environments
(such as Flash or Silverlight) and to achieve transition effects such
as slide, zoom and fade. </p><p>Symbian provides more than one render
stage solution. The following diagram provides a simplified representation
of one possible solution (called <em>solution A</em> in this topic).
This solution is full featured. The diagram focuses on the more relevant
components and does not attempt to show all components in the complete
solution. This solution has a dependency on the S60 middleware layer,
in particular on the Hitchcock component (which is in the UI Accelerator
package). </p><div class="figure" id="GUID-0D91F9A6-68FC-5316-A16D-A3238F8452AD"><img src="GUID-643AFF2D-3EDB-5FAB-9631-7B93FABC56B6_d0e246390_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>            Render stage solution A            </p></div><p>Another possible solution (called <em>solution B</em>) is based
on the DirectGDI and Graphics Resource components (which are described
next), both of which have interface and adaptation layers. This solution
is not full featured. Like the previous diagram, this diagram focuses
on the more relevant components and does not attempt to show everything. </p><div class="figure" id="GUID-6A761DC5-1141-5515-BD03-09FBFE56F2D7"><img src="GUID-3DD37A41-E822-5CB6-A59E-0B309B5627D9_d0e246402_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>Render stage solution B</p></div><p>Both of these render stage solutions mean that existing Window
Server applications can take advantage of hardware acceleration if
it is available (and therefore run faster) without recompiling the
code. </p><p>ScreenPlay provides extensions to the Window Server client-side
API, which enable mobile devices to respond to events from a number
of pointers, including their proximity and pressure. This feature
is known as <a href="GUID-A12A66ED-2C8F-5CE6-8F3E-332B045A35B4.html">advanced pointers</a>. </p><p>A new API, <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-643DDA78-C7A7-386D-AB3F-8710141DDDA9.html#GUID-B431DC60-D11F-3239-8F52-4257B9B0E0C9"><code class="apiname">RWsSession::Finish()</code></a>, has been added to allow Window Server client applications to synchronize
with the completion of Window Server rendering. The existing API, <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-643DDA78-C7A7-386D-AB3F-8710141DDDA9.html#GUID-B83C6F44-1A3E-3959-910C-CBBF66C4A3D4"><code class="apiname">RWsSession::Flush()</code></a>, is redefined to simply flush the client-side
command buffer, whereas previously it also provided a guarantee that
Window Server had completed the command bufferâs operations. This
behavioral change allows legacy clients to benefit from the asynchronous
hardware rendering when supported by the render stage plug-in(s) that
are in use. </p><p>For more information, see <a href="GUID-57A777A3-5D67-5CBB-B224-B7AD422A451B.html">Windowing Collection</a>. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-D67558F6-7841-487F-8F73-7580C2EFC026"><h3 class="section-title">DirectGDI</h3><p>DirectGDI provides a graphics context that can be hardware accelerated
and allows an asynchronous interface. DirectGDI has two parts: a generic
layer, which provides a client API and an adaptation layer. Device
creators can replace the adaptation layer with an implementation that
takes advantage of graphics accelerated hardware, if it is available,
or a software implementation, if it is not available. </p><p>DirectGDI
was introduced as a prototype in the development of ScreenPlay. It
is deprecated in Symbian^3.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-DF3BDD08-1C11-4FC6-BA4C-30CC13BE6005"><h3 class="section-title">Graphics
Resource</h3><p>The Graphics Resource component provides an abstraction
layer for the memory management of pixel and non-pixel data (such
as OpenVG command lists). Like DirectGDI, it has a generic part, which
provides a client API and an adaptation part, which device creators
can adapt to take advantage of graphics hardware when it is available. </p><p>The Graphics Resource component was introduced as a prototype
in the development of ScreenPlay. It is deprecated in Symbian^3 and
will be removed in Symbian^4.  However, a new Graphics Resource Interface
component is planned for S^4. This new component will provide a similar
but reduced API that is optimized for sharing images across processes.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-35870066-DB83-477E-8532-002E1F91E9CF"><h3 class="section-title">OpenVG,
OpenGL ES and EGL</h3><p>Symbian provides support for OpenVG, OpenGL
ES and EGL. The main advantage of ScreenPlay with regard to EGL is
that EGL can render into composition surfaces. For application developers
this offers the ability to have semi-transparent GDI content on top
of EGL content. The EGL client can query whether these new features
are supported on the particular device. </p> <p>For more information,
see <a href="GUID-50254C2F-57B6-58C4-911F-294EF2B79C04.html">Khronos
API Support</a>. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-3B11D2F8-F3A4-4A2F-938A-B8EA0F64134A"><h3 class="section-title">Screen
Driver</h3><p>In ScreenPlay, the implementation of the Screen Driver
has been changed so that DSA content can be passed into the composition
engine. </p></div>
