<p>This topic describes key concepts of the Central Repository. </p>
<div id="GUID-F493C646-CD65-491D-9114-743C09AC8976"><h3 class="section-title">Purpose </h3> <p>The Central Repository is a collection of data structures which
retains the setup of an application or component from one session
to another. It is a fast, flexible mechanism for the persistence of
data and, being global, is preferable to the use of separate .ini
files for each application. It is typically used by applications such
as messaging services to retrieve logins, localisation data and information
needed for interprocess communication. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-69A757C6-B9D1-475F-9DC0-B4CC65FEEDC4"><h3 class="section-title"> Architecture </h3> <p>An individual data structure referring to a particular application
or component is termed a repository. An item of information in a repository
is termed a setting. Conceptually, the Central Repository is comparable
to a folder, an individual repository to a file and a setting to a
line in a file. In fact repositories are implemented as binary files
held at various locations in memory and are accessed through C++ classes
which encapsulate them with a single API. For some purposes developers
can safely think in terms of the folder/file/lines model, but for
other purposes an understanding of implementation is necessary. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-491C4DA0-D143-4A80-BBEC-B248FE53AD49"><h3 class="section-title"> Usage:
how not to use the Central Repository </h3> <p>An important feature
of the Central Repository is best illustrated by a brief guide to
how not to use it. </p> <p>In your application code, create a C++
CCentralRepository object. At runtime, call its read function to retrieve
the settings of your application. You will find that the object has
nothing to read from because the repository it encapsulates has not
previously been created. Try calling the create repository function
of the CCentralRepository object. You will find that it has not got
one. </p> <p>Go back to square one. Create the repository from an
initialisation file and convert it to binary format, as explained
in this guide. Now call the read function of the CCentralRepository
object. You will find that you cannot read or write to the repository:
this is because you didn't previously create an access policy for
the repository. </p> <p>Go back to square one. Define an access policy,
as explained in this guide. Rewrite the initialisation file and proceed
as before. This time you may find that the data you are trying to
read has been lost because you didn't previously provide for it to
be backed up. </p> <p>Go back to square one. Define a backup mechanism
- No! Better still, throw this useless documentation out of the window.
And if it bounces back at you, that is because you didn't previously
open the window. </p> <p>The point is that use of the Central Repository
to persist application settings involves work at the design stage
of the application. You cannot first create the application and procede
to interface to the Central Repository as an afterthought. When an
existing application with a different persistence mechanism is migrated
to the Central Repository, substantial rewriting of the application
code may be necessary. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-CCEA88F5-54FB-47B9-A33F-391A4BBA3A51"><h3 class="section-title">Structure
of the Central Repository</h3> <p>In the simplest case, a repository
holds an unordered list of items and the same application reads, writes
and backs up the data. However, a use case as simple as that would
be unusual. More often, the data has an internal structure which must
also be persisted. For instance, it might reflect the contents of
a number of C++ classes, of a number of data tables or of a number
of arrays of different data types. It is also common for data to be
written to a repository by one application and retrieved by another
(this requires a mechanism for notification of changes). Backup might
be the responsibility of a different application or component entirely. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-3EFBD23C-2B88-47AE-B764-85EB42713E4D"><h3 class="section-title">Structure
of the initialisation file</h3> <p>Repositories are created from
a text file called an initialisation file: the following is an example
of one. The structure of an initialisation file is the key to understanding
the functionality of the Central Repository. </p> <pre class="codeblock"># 00000001.txt

</pre> <p>The lines beginning with # are comments. The actual
data consists of five sections in this order: header, owner, default
metadata, platform security and main. </p> <p><strong>The header </strong> </p> <p>The header consists of the lines </p> <pre class="codeblock">cenrep
version 1
</pre> <p>This is obligatory and the same for every repository.
Cenrep means Central Repository and version 1 refers to the file format:
only version 1 exists. </p> <p><strong>Owner </strong> </p> <p>This section specifies a particular application
as the owner of the repository. It is the owning application which
backs a repository up. This section is optional: it is not obligatory
to specify an owner. </p> <p><strong>Default metadata </strong> </p> <p>The default metadata section is
optional. It supplements the metadata specified in the main section
and uses the key space mechanism also used in the main section. </p> <p><strong>Platform security </strong> </p> <p>This section is theoretically optional.
However, if you omit it the application being persisted will have
neither read nor write permissions on the repository. The section
assigns permissions to particular applications and components or groups
of them. The content of the platform security section is called a
security policy and its structure is explained below. </p> <p><strong>Main </strong> </p> <p>This section is mandatory and it holds the initial
data to be written to the repository when it is created. The lines
consist of attribute value pairs and related data in a format which
is partly laid down in the Central Repository specification and partly
user-defined. An understanding of this format is required to use the
library functions which read and modify the repository once it is
created. Each line of the section refers to a setting or group of
settings to be persisted and consists of four fields, for instance </p> <pre class="codeblock">0x11 real 1.5 12</pre> <p>called key, type, value and metadata. </p> <p>The key field (0x11)
represents an attribute name. The type field (real) is the data type
of its value: this must be one of int, real, string, string8 or binary.
The value field (1.5) is the actual value. The metadata field (12)
is a supplementary value, the metadata value. </p> <p>The key field
is the one which is difficult to understand. It represents an attribute
name such as 'password' or 'country code' which has been converted
into a numerical value using a translation scheme called a key space.
(The virtue of numerical values is that they improve retrieval times.)
The key space is specific to an application and is defined when the
application is being designed. </p> <p><strong>Use of decimal and hexadecimal numbers </strong> </p> <p>Numbers used
to identify settings and values in initialisation files may be written
either in decimal or hexadecimal notation (hexadecimal numbers take
the prefix "0x"). Both notations will be encountered in the examples
given here. Use of decimal or hexadecimal notation is purely a matter
of convenience: hexadecimal notation is often used for keys in order
to reflect their internal structure. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-01177FE1-7AED-54FD-B0C1-F29A6389F93A"><h3 class="section-title">Key
spaces</h3> <p>The Central Repository API accesses data items in
a repository by their keys. In source code, the data items which correspond
to settings have meaningful names such as pluginName and userID: the
purpose of a key space is to translate names into numerical keys for
speed of retrieval. As part of the design process of your application
you identify the settings to be persisted and also identify their
dependencies. Then you construct a key space to represent them. A
key consists of 32 binary digits (bits): a key space imposes a structure
on the digits. You might use the 32 bits to represent pairs of 16
bit integers, or reserve eight of them as binary flags and use the
rest to represent 24 bit integers, or define four key spaces using
only 30 bits and use the other two bits to indicate which of those
four key spaces the key belongs to. </p> <p>Why would you want to
do this? The simplest use for 32 bits is to represent an integer between
0 and 2<sup>32</sup>. If the data to be persisted consists of a simple
list, this is the right thing to do. For instance you might have a
list of telephone numbers representing missed calls and simply want
to store and retrieve them. In such a case, all you need to do is
label the data items with an integer: missed call 0, missed call 1,
missed call 2 and so on up to missed call 2<sup>32</sup> if necessary.
This is also the appropriate strategy if you are persisting a list
of fixed size and various data types, for instance an enumeration
of userName, userID, password and the like. Data sets of this kind
would be stored in a data table as either a single column or a single
row. </p> <p>More commonly, the data to be persisted is comparable
to the contents of a data table with many columns and many rows. In
C++ data sets of this kind are often held as arrays of class objects.
A register of missed calls would probably not just list telephone
numbers but also data such as the time of the call and the name of
the caller: a definite number of data items information (table columns,
class members) relating to an indefinite number of missed calls (table
rows, array items). To encode this information in a key space we need
to reserve part of the key to represent the column names as 0, 1,
2... Suppose that there are 16 columns (2<sup>4</sup>). Four bits
of the key are required to represent the column names leaving another
28 to represent row numbers (missed call 0, missed call 1 etc as before).
This keyspace can conveniently be written as eight hexadecimal numbers,
one representing the column names and the rest representing the row
numbers. </p> <p>A further level of complexity arises when the data
to be persisted is comparable to the contents of several data tables.
To extend our example of the missed telephone calls, we might also
want to persist data concerning calls actually received. A record
representing received calls would be different from one representing
a missed call: we should want to know the length of the call and information
such as the tariff, the network used and so on. In such a case you
need to represent three separate items of data: the table name, the
column name and the row number. If there are four tables, you need
two bits of the key to represent the table names, leaving 30 bits
to represent the rows and columns. It is important to know that you
do not have to allocate the 30 bits identically for each of the four
tables. One of them might have many columns, say 256, requiring eight
bits to hold the column names and 22 to hold the row numbers. The
others might only have 16 columns, requiring four bits to hold the
column names and 26 to hold the row numbers. </p> <p>For the sake
of simplicity the examples just given involve numbers which are exact
powers of two. In practice this will not usually be so, and a certain
amount of rounding up will be needed. </p> <p>You sometimes want to
refer to a group of settings without specifying each individual key.
There are two ways of doing this. One is to specify a range of contiguous
keys by simply naming the first and last key in the range: for instance
the pair 0x00000011 0x0000001F identifies a range of sixteen keys
from 0x11 to 0x1F (17 to 31) inclusive. The other way is to use a
pattern matching mechanism to specify sets of keys which are not necessarily
contiguous. </p> <p>Suppose you have a key representing two 16 bit
integers encoding columns and rows of a data table, and you want to
set or retrieve all the row values for a particular column. In hexadecimal
notation the keys you want look like this. </p> <pre class="codeblock">
0x00080001
0x00080002
0x00080003
</pre> <p>In this example, you want the first four hexadecimal
digits of the key to match a pattern which you specify and the last
four to match any values. To do this you construct two hexadecimal
numbers: a key mask and a partial key. The key mask is a sequence
of Fs and 0s in which the Fs mark the mandatory fields and the 0s
mark the non-mandatory ones: </p> <pre class="codeblock">0xFFFF0000</pre> <p>The partial key is the pattern to be matched: where no values
are to be matched you write 0 instead: </p> <pre class="codeblock">0x00080000</pre> <p>These two numbers, key mask and partial key, taken together specify
a list of all the repository keys whose first four hexadecimal digits
are 0008. Key mask and partial key pairs are passed as parameters
to API functions and are used in the initialisation file to identify
groups of keys. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-07777876-8E76-57BD-8858-55EF3AD7641E"><h3 class="section-title">Identifying
applications</h3> <p>You need to specify which applications may
access your repository. Applications may be identified by individual
secure IDs (SIDs) or as groups by capabilities. The SID is the unique
identifier of an application which is given to it by Symbian Signed.
Capabilities are categories to which the Symbian platform assigns
applications and components for purposes of security classification.
Each capability has a mnemonic, and is also defined by an individual
enum value of the TCapability enum. Follow the
link to the individual TCapability enum value: </p> <div class="tablenoborder"><a name="GUID-4A0AD7D5-7016-51AE-B5EE-FA05BD9BA4BE"><!-- --></a><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="GUID-4A0AD7D5-7016-51AE-B5EE-FA05BD9BA4BE" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">
