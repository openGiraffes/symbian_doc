<div id="GUID-A3DC5F3F-92C6-4847-A9C5-A227F777D7D3"><h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3> <p>INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations are all very fast. However,
COMMIT statements are very slow. You need to consider several techniques
to ensure you make the best use of COMMIT statements. </p> <p><strong>Intended audience:</strong> </p> <p>This document is intended to be
used by Symbian platfomr licensees and third party application developers. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-C12416F0-87D5-59AA-A08F-A1741A3FD3ED"><h3 class="section-title">INSERT
and UPDATE are Fast but COMMIT is Slow</h3> <p>A programmer migrating
to this database engine might write a test program to see how many
INSERT statements per second it can do. They create an empty database
with a single empty table. Then they write a loop that runs a few
thousand times and does a single INSERT statement on each iteration.
Upon timing this program they find that it appears to only be doing
a couple of dozen INSERTs per second. </p> <p>“Everybody I talked
to says SQLite is suppose to be really fast”, the new programmer will
typically complain, “But I'm only getting 20 or 30 INSERTs per second!” </p> <p>In reality, SQLite can achieve around 50000 or more INSERTs per
second on a modern workstation, although less on a typical embedded
platform. But the characteristics of the underlying storage medium
and the fact that the database engine guarantees atomic updates to
the database mean that it can only achieve a few dozen COMMIT operations
per second. </p> <p>Unless you take specific action to tell SQLite
to do otherwise, it will automatically insert a COMMIT operation after
every insert. So the programmers described above are really measuring
the number of transactions per second, not the number of INSERTs.
This is a very important distinction. </p> <p>Why is COMMIT so much
slower than INSERT? SQLite guarantees that changes to a database are
ACID – Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable. The Atomic and Durable
parts are what take the time. </p> <p>In order to be Atomic, the database
engine has to go through an elaborate protocol with the underlying
file system, which ultimately means that every modified page of the
database file must be written twice. </p> <p>In order to be durable,
the COMMIT operation must not return until all content has been safely
written to nonvolatile media. At least two consecutive non-concurrent
writes to flash memory must occur in order to COMMIT. </p> <p>An atomic
and durable COMMIT is a very powerful feature that can help you to
build a system that is resilient, even in the face of unplanned system
crashes or power failures. But the price of this resilience is that
COMMIT is a relatively slow operation. Hence if performance is a priority
you should strive to minimize the number of COMMITs. </p> <p>If you
need to do more than one INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE operation, you
are advised to put them all inside a single explicit transaction by
running the BEGIN statement prior to the first changes and executing
COMMIT once all changes have finished. In this way, all your changes
occur within a single transaction and only a single time-consuming
COMMIT operation must occur. </p> <p>If you omit the explicit BEGIN...COMMIT,
then SQLite automatically inserts an implicit BEGIN...COMMIT around
each of your INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, which means you
end of doing many COMMITs which will always be much slower than doing
just one. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-0E57010E-E3AB-573E-B550-72DE36725D1B"><h3 class="section-title">Batch
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE Operations Using TEMP Tables</h3> <p>As described above, when you have many changes to make to a database,
you are advised to make all those changes within a single explicit
transaction by preceding the first change with a BEGIN statement and
concluding the changes with a COMMIT statement. </p> <p>The problem
with BEGIN...COMMIT is that BEGIN acquires an exclusive lock on the
database file which is not released until the COMMIT completes. That
means that only a single connection to the database can be in the
middle of a BEGIN...COMMIT at one time. If another thread or process
tries to start a BEGIN...COMMIT while the first is busy, the second
has to wait. To avoid holding up other threads and processes, therefore,
every BEGIN should be followed by a COMMIT as quickly as possible. </p> <p>But sometimes you run into a situation where you have to make
periodic INSERTs or UPDATEs to a database based on timed or external
events. For example, you may want to do an INSERT into an event log
table once every 250 milliseconds or so. You could do a separate INSERT
for each event, but that would mean doing a separate COMMIT four times
per second, which is perhaps more overhead than you desire. On the
other hand, if you did a BEGIN and accumulated several seconds worth
of INSERTs you could avoid doing a COMMIT except for every 10<sup>th</sup> second or so. The trouble there is that other threads and
processes are unable to write to the database while the event log
is holding its transaction open. </p> <p>The usual method for avoiding
this dilemma is to store all of the INSERTs in a separate TEMP table,
then periodically flush the content of the TEMP table into the main
database with a single operation. </p> <p>A TEMP table works just
like a regular database table except that a TEMP table is only visible
to the database connection that creates it, and the TEMP table is
automatically dropped when the database connection is closed. You
create a TEMP table by inserting the “TEMP” or “TEMPORARY” keyword
in between “CREATE” and “TABLE”, like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TEMP TABLE event_accumulator(
        eventId INTEGER,
        eventArg TEXT
    );
</pre> <p>Because TEMP tables are ephemeral (meaning that they
do not persist after the database connection closes) SQLite does not
need to worry about making writes to a TEMP table atomic or durable.
Hence a COMMIT to a TEMP table is very quick. </p> <p>A process can
do multiple INSERTs into a TEMP table without having to enclose those
INSERTs within an explicit BEGIN...COMMIT for efficiency. Writes to
a TEMP table are always efficient regardless of whether or not they
are enclosed in an explicit transaction. </p> <p>So as events arrive,
they can be written into the TEMP table using isolated INSERT statements.
But because the TEMP table is ephemeral, one must take care to periodically
flush the contents of the TEMP table into the main database where
they will persist. So every 10 seconds or so (depending on the application
requirements) you can run code like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO event_log SELECT * FROM event_accumulator;
DELETE FROM event_accumulator;
COMMIT;
</pre> <p>These statements transfer the content of the ephemeral
event_accumulator table over to the persistent event_log table as
a single atomic operation. Since this transfer occurs relatively infrequently,
minimal database overhead is incurred. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-83C876AB-7C3F-5BFC-8F02-6503A0B3D8D6"><h3 class="section-title">Use
Bound Parameters</h3> <p>Suppose you have a descriptor, nameDes,
and you want to insert that value into the namelist table of a database.
One way to proceed is to construct an appropriate INSERT statement
that contains the desired string value as a SQL string literal, then
run that INSERT statement. Pseudo-code for this approach follows: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
_LIT(KSql, “INSERT INTO namelist VALUES('%S')”);
sqlBuf.Format(KSql, nameDes);
sqlDatabase.Execute(sql);
</pre> <p>The INSERT statement is constructed by the call to <code class="codeph">Format()</code> on the second line of the example above. The first
argument is a template for the SQL statement. The value of the nameDes
descriptor is inserted where the %S occurs in the template. Notice
that the %S is surrounded by single quotes so that the string will
be properly contained in SQL standard quotes. </p> <p>This approach
works as long as the value in nameDes does not contain any single-quote
characters. If nameDes does contain one or more single-quotes, then
the string literal in the INSERT statement will not be well-formed
and a syntax error might occur. Or worse, if a hostile user is able
to control the content of nameDes, they might be able to put text
in nameDes that looked something like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
hi'); DELETE FROM critical_table; SELECT 'hi
</pre> <p>This would result in the sqlBuf variable holding </p> <pre class="codeblock">
INSERT INTO namelist VALUES('hi'); DELETE FROM critical_table; SELECT 'hi'
</pre> <p>Your adversary has managed to convert your single
INSERT statement into three separate SQL statements, one of which
does things that you probably do not want to happen. This is called
an “SQL Injection Attack”. You want to be very, very careful to avoid
SQL injection attacks as they can seriously compromise the security
of your application. </p> <p>SQLite allows you to specify parameters
in SQL statements and then substitute values for those parameters
prior to running the SQL. Parameters can take several forms, including: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
?
?NNN
:AAA
@AAA
$AAA
</pre> <p>In the above, NNN means any sequence of digits and
AAA means any sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores.
In this example we will stick with the first and simplest form – the
question mark. The operation above would be rewritten as shown below.
(Error checking is omitted from this example for brevity.) </p> <pre class="codeblock">
_LIT(KSql, “INSERT INTO namelist VALUES(?)”);
RSqlStatement s;
s.PrepareL(db, KSql);
s.BindText(1, nameDes);
s.Exec();
s.Close();
</pre> <p> <code class="codeph"> PrepareL()</code> compiles the SQL statement
held in the literal KSql. This statement contains a single parameter.
The value for this parameter is initially NULL. </p> <p>The <code class="codeph">BindText()</code> sets the value of this parameter to the content
of the <code class="codeph">nameDes</code> descriptor and then <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> executes the SQL statement with the bound parameter value. </p> <p>There are variations of <code class="codeph">BindXxx()</code> to bind other
kinds of values such as integers, floating point numbers, and binary
large objects (BLOBs). The key point to observe is that none of these
values need to be quoted or escaped in any way. And there is no possibility
of being vulnerable to an SQL injection attack. </p> <p>Besides reducing
your vulnerability to SQL injection attacks, the use of bound parameters
also happens to be more efficient that constructing SQL statements
from scratch, especially when inserting large strings or BLOBs. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-3EC5A35D-67E0-5C85-9DA3-CD6AA40BB6A7"><h3 class="section-title">Cache
and Reuse Prepared Statements</h3> <p>Using RSqlStatement is a two-step process. Firstly the statement must be compiled using <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code>. Then the resulting prepared statement is run
using either <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> or <code class="codeph">Next()</code>. </p> <p>The relative amount of time spent doing each of these steps depends
on the nature of the SQL statement. SELECT statements that return
a large result set or UPDATE or DELETE statements that touch many
rows of a table will normally spend most of their time in the Virtual
Machine module and relatively little time being compiled. But simple
INSERT statements on the other hand, can take twice as long to compile
as they take to run in the virtual machine. </p> <p>A simple way to
reduce the CPU load of an application that uses SQLite is to cache
the prepared statements and reuse them. Of course, one rarely needs
to run the exact same SQL statement more than once. But if a statement
contains one or more bound parameters, you can bind new values to
the parameters prior to each run and thus accomplish something different
with each invocation. </p> <p>This technique is especially effective
when doing multiple INSERTs into the same table. Instead of preparing
a separate insert for each row, create a single generic insert statement
like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
INSERT INTO important_table VALUES(?,?,?,?,?)
</pre> <p>Then for each row to be inserted, use one or more
of the <code class="codeph">BindXxx()</code> interfaces to bind values to the
parameters in the insert statement, and call <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> to do the insert, then call <code class="codeph">Reset()</code> to rewind the
program counter of the internal bytecode in preparation for the next
run. </p> <p>For INSERT statements, reusing a single prepared statement
in this way will typically make your code run two or three times faster. </p> <p>You can manually manage a cache of prepared statements, keeping
around only those prepared statements that you know will be needed
again and closing prepared statements using <code class="codeph">Close()</code> when you are done with them or when they are about to fall out of
scope. But depending on the application, it can be more convenient
to create a wrapper class around the SQL interface that manages the
cache automatically. </p> <p>A wrapper class can keep around the 5
or 10 most recently used prepared statements and reuse those statements
if the same SQL is requested. Handling the prepared statement cache
automatically in a wrapper has the advantage that it frees you to
focus more mental energy on writing a great application and less effort
on operating the database interface. It also makes the programming
task less error prone since with an automatic class, there is no chance
of accidentally omitting a call to <code class="codeph">Close()</code> and leaking
prepared statements. </p> <p>The downside is that a cache wrapper
will not have the foresight of a human programmer and will often cache
prepared statements that are no longer needed, thus using excess memory,
or sometimes discard prepared statements just before they are needed
again. </p> <p>This is a classic ease-of-programming versus performance
trade-off. For applications that are intended for a high-power workstation,
it can be best to go with a wrapper class that handles the cache automatically.
But when designing an application for a resource constrained devices
where performance is critical and engineering design talent is plentiful,
it may be better to manage the cache manually. </p> <p>Regardless
of whether or not the prepared statement cache is managed manually
or automatically using a wrapper class, reusing prepared statements
is always a good thing, and can in some cases double or triple the
performance of the application. </p> </div>
