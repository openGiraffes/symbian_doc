Markers and Panics in GLib-based Applications</h1><div><p>The 2.10.x version of GLib has introduced a new type of memory
allocator called slice allocator. These allocators allocate memory in page
sizes even for a small request of something like 20 bytes. Once a huge chunk
has been allocated, all the future memory requests are granted using the chunk
that was allocated for the first memory request. Once the free pool runs out,
another huge chunk is allocated.  </p>
<p>Whenever the memory is freed using <code class="codeph">g_slice_free1()</code>, the
memory is not returned to the OS; instead it is maintained by GLib as free
memory which is used to for future memory requests.  </p>
<p>The following example explains the issue. The code given below uses slice
allocators to allocate 10 bytes of memory using <code class="codeph">g_slice_alloc()</code> and
subsequently frees it using <code class="codeph">g_slice_free1()</code>. The code panics
at <code class="codeph">__UHEAP_MARKEND</code>, although the memory that has been allocated
has been deallocated. This is because all the allocated memory on the heap
has not been deallocated. When the user calls <code class="codeph">g_slice_free1()</code> to
free up, the memory is not freed; instead, GLib will keep it as part of the
free pool for future allocation.  </p>
<pre class="codeblock">#include &lt;glib.h&gt;
#include &lt;e32base.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char *x;
  __UHEAP_MARK;
  x = (char *)g_slice_alloc(10);
  g_slice_free1(10,x);
  __UHEAP_MARKEND;
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>To get around this problem, define an environment variable <code class="codeph">G_SLICE</code> and
set it to “always-malloc”.</p>
<div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>It is necessary that this environment variable is set before any GLib
call that can cause memory allocation. If the environment variable is set
after any </p><code class="codeph">g_slice*</code> APIs have been called either from the
application code or from GLib library code, setting it has not effect.</div>
<p>The code below demonstrates the usage.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">#include &lt;glib.h&gt;
#include &lt;e32base.h&gt;

int main()
{
  char *x;
  __UHEAP_MARK;
 	g_setenv("G_SLICE","always-malloc",1);
  x = (char *)g_slice_alloc(10);
  g_slice_free1(10,x);
 __UHEAP_MARKEND;
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong></p><code class="codeph">G_SLICE</code> is just a debugging environment variable. Setting
it to “always-malloc” can help in detecting memory leaks in application code.
This setting need not and should not be done in the release code since doing
it overrides the GLib memory allocation mechanism and hence may
result in loss of efficiency. The slice allocators are used by other GLib
APIs like <code class="codeph">GList</code>, <code class="codeph">GSList</code>, <code class="codeph">GNode</code>,
and so on. Thus setting the environment variable is necessary if the application
makes use of any such APIs that might use slice allocators.</div>
