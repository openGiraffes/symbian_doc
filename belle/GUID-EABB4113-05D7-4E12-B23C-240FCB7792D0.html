<div id="GUID-6B4FEB3E-EE19-46AA-8F32-4F19E381CAF6"><h3 class="section-title">Symbian
coding standards</h3><p>Symbian's coding standards cover code formatting,
safety, ease of maintenance and efficiency. This topic provides a
summary of the most applicable points from the standard that relate
specifically to Symbian idioms. </p><p>For a full introduction to
the Symbian idioms and conventions, see <a href="GUID-C3206E31-251C-4AFC-90C2-04B38CCF8E18.html">Introduction to Symbian
C++ development</a>.</p><p><strong>Code safety </strong></p><p><em>Memory
allocation failure </em></p><p>When memory is allocated on the heap,
it is essential to determine whether the allocation succeeded or failed,
and act accordingly. Use the leaving overload of the <code class="codeph">new</code> operator (<code class="codeph">new(ELeave)</code>), or check the pointer returned
from the call to allocate the memory against <code class="codeph">NULL</code>. </p><p><em>No side-effects from assertions </em></p><p>Assertion
statements must not perform ‘side effects’, such as modifying the
value of a variable. </p><p><em>Strings and buffers</em></p><p>Use proven
string classes like the <a href="GUID-21627ABC-AA70-4837-89A1-28BD9B2FD4B0.html">Symbian descriptor
classes</a> in preference to native strings and memory buffers
or hand-crafted string classes. Classes provided by the Qt application
framework (<code class="codeph">QString</code> and <code class="codeph">QByteArray</code>) are suitable alternatives and classes provided by the STL ports
available. Be extremely careful when dealing with C-style strings
and arrays.  </p><p><em>Multiple inheritance</em> </p><p>Only use multiple
inheritance through interfaces defined by <a href="GUID-2458916B-55B2-5E08-A825-4EBDB3503E67.html">M classes</a>.
Inherit from one <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-8F6FE089-E2A8-30F4-B67E-10F286347681.html#GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-8F6FE089-E2A8-30F4-B67E-10F286347681.html"><code class="apiname">CBase</code></a>-derived class and one or
more M classes. (Put the CBase-derived class first in the inheritance
list to ensure that destruction by the cleanup stack occurs correctly.) </p><p><em>Object construction </em></p><p>The code inside a C++ constructor
must not leave.</p><p>Implement non-trivial construction and initialization
code that can fail in the second phase of a two-phase constructor,
typically in a <code class="codeph">ConstructL()</code> method. </p><p><em>Safe
cleanup</em></p><p>Use the cleanup stack to avoid orphaning memory
or resources in the event of a leave. </p><p>If an object is deleted,
do not put it on the cleanup stack. </p><p>An object must not be simultaneously
owned by another object and on the cleanup stack. This means that
class member data should never be placed on the cleanup stack if it
is also destroyed in the class destructor, as is usually the case. </p><p>Functions with a ‘C’ suffix on their name (such as <code class="codeph">NewLC()</code>) automatically put a pointer to the object(s) they allocate on the
cleanup stack. Therefore, those objects must not also be pushed on
to the cleanup stack explicitly or they will be present twice. </p><p>A <code class="codeph">TRAP</code> can be used within a destructor of a class
stored on the heap. However, it is not safe to use a TRAP within any
destructor that may be called as the stack unwinds. </p><p>When calling
code that can throw a C++ exception, catch everything and convert
the exceptions to leaves. TRAP and TRAPD panic if they receive a C++
exception that was not raised by a Symbian leave (of type <code class="codeph">XLeaveException</code>). </p><p><strong>Ease of maintenance </strong></p><p><em>Use and comment assertions </em></p><p>Use the <code class="codeph">__ASSERT_DEBUG</code> assertion macro liberally to detect programming errors. It may sometimes
also be appropriate to use <code class="codeph">__ASSERT_ALWAYS</code> to catch
invalid runtime input. </p><p>Use comments to explain assertion statements
and the assumptions they make. This makes the code easier to maintain. </p><p><em>Naming conventions </em></p><p>Use the concrete types defined
in <code>e32def.h</code> in lieu of the language-defined basic
types. For example, use <code class="codeph">TInt</code> instead of <code class="codeph">int</code>. </p><p><em>Interface classes </em></p><p>Use M classes to specify
the interface only, not the implementation. Generally M classes should
contain only pure virtual functions. </p><p><em>Descriptor parameters </em></p><p>When using descriptors as function parameters, use the base
classes (<code class="codeph">TDes</code> and <code class="codeph">TDesC</code>) and pass
them by reference. </p><p><em>Handling date and time values </em></p><p>Use the Symbian date and time classes (such as <code class="codeph">TDateTime</code> and <code class="codeph">TTime</code>) instead of hand-crafted alternatives. </p><p><em>Static factory functions</em> </p><p>Where two-phase construction
is used, provide one or more public static factory functions (typically
called <code class="codeph">NewL()</code> and <code class="codeph">NewLC()</code>) for object
construction. The construction methods themselves should be private
or protected. </p><p><em>Check correct cleanup</em></p><p>Use the checking
methods of <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-0DD554D7-B9B1-3FD3-898F-4D855144FCEA.html#GUID-9520A1B5-B1D0-379B-BFAD-443AB20EECFE"><code class="apiname">CleanupStack::Pop()</code></a> and <code class="codeph">CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy()</code> where possible, to check that <code class="codeph">PushL()</code> and <code class="codeph">Pop()</code> calls are balanced. </p><p><strong>Efficiency </strong></p><p><em>Minimize stack use </em></p><p>Minimize stack use as much as is
possible. For example, use the heap to store large data structures
instead of the stack and take care when declaring larger stack-based
variables within loops or recursive functions. Use of the <code class="codeph">TFileName</code> and TParse classes is a common
cause of stack consumption, because objects of both these types are
over 512 bytes in size. (Remember that the default stack size is only
8KB.) </p><p><em>Avoid writable global data in DLLs </em></p><p>Where
possible avoid the use of writable global data in DLLs.</p><p><em>Literals </em></p><p>Do not use the <code class="codeph">_L</code> macro for literal descriptors
except where it is convenient to do so in test code. Instead , use
the <code class="codeph">_LIT</code> macro for literal descriptors. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-12DF0EE7-F007-42A9-A3E8-0BDC375820DF"><h3 class="section-title">Qt
coding standards</h3><p>Qt provides a compact set of coding guidelines
that are separated into <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtCodingStyle" target="_blank">Coding Style</a> and <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/CodingConventions" target="_blank">Coding Conventions</a>. The former defines best-practice
for code format and layout, while the conventions discuss C++ features
you should not use, approaches to including headers, casting, maintaining
binary compatibility, and compiler specific issues. As you would expect,
there is a clear focus on coding to ensure cross platform compatibility. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-DA2F294D-D4B2-4D21-8D4E-43EEF97E3981"><h3 class="section-title">Coding
standards for mixed Symbian C++ and Qt code</h3><p>Qt applications
should follow the <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtCodingStyle" target="_blank">Qt Coding Style</a> rules for code layout in both Symbian C++
and Qt code. In other respects the Qt code should follow the Qt conventions
and Symbian C++ code should follow the <a href="GUID-C50A3F22-FF47-4074-9A8B-E1E8EFDF65EA.html">Symbian
programming conventions</a>. </p><p>This approach is followed in
the Telephony application accompanying this documentation. The exception
to this rule is that the <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate</code> class is
a Symbian C class (derived from <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-067293BF-B28C-3CEC-92F4-1351A795EA7F.html#GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-067293BF-B28C-3CEC-92F4-1351A795EA7F.html"><code class="apiname">CActive</code></a>), and should
therefore be named using the <code class="codeph">C</code>  prefix. However,
this prefix is not used in order to maintain the "opacity" of the
private implementation. The risk of not using the class prefix is
low because the <code class="codeph">Telephony</code> class is its only user. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-FD0191B5-FAC1-4DB4-A526-76289C70CE5E"><h3 class="section-title">File
and class naming conventions </h3><div class="p">In general, if the public
class is called <code class="codeph">QMyClass</code>: <ul>
<li><p>The private class is <code class="codeph">QMyClassPrivate</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Public class source and header files share the name of the
public class: <code>qmyclass.h,qmyclass.cpp</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Private class headers and source file names are terminated
with <code class="codeph">_p</code> (such as <code>qmyclass_p.h</code>) unless the file is a platform-specific implementation. </p></li>
<li><p>Platform-specific implementation headers and source files include
the platform in the file name - e.g. <code>qmyclass_symbian.cpp</code> (the <em>_p</em> is not necessary because it is implied). </p></li>
</ul></div></div>
