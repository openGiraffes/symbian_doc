interface DLL</h1><div><p>A polymorphic interface DLL is one which is written to implement
a programming interface defined elsewhere; for example, a device driver, an
application or an OPL extension.</p>
<p>The API is defined in terms of a single abstract class whose functions
are declared as pure virtual. The DLL <em>implements</em> the API by defining
and implementing a concrete class derived from that abstract class. The DLL
exports a single function whose sole purpose is to create an object of the
derived class type; this is always the function at ordinal 1 within the DLL.
All other functions in the DLL are called through the virtual table mechanism
(the pointer to the vtable is set up by the constructor in the normal C++
way).</p>
<p>At compilation time, application code includes the header file(s) which
define(s) the API. At link time, the application includes the DLL's module
definition file, which allows the address of the DLL function to be accessed
by specifying its ordinal.</p>
<p>When the application's executable runs, it loads the DLL at the time it
is required. The address of the single function exported by the DLL is accessed
indirectly by specifying its ordinal.</p>
<p>For a given interface, there may be many DLLs which obey the protocol imposed
by that interface each of which provides a different implementation.</p>
<p>A DLL of this type is often referred to as a dynamically loaded DLL.</p>
<p>The user of a dynamically loaded DLL uses an <code class="codeph">RLibrary</code> type
object to load the DLL. The <code class="codeph">RLibrary</code> object encapsulates
a handle to the DLL and must remain in existence while the DLL is in use;
typically this is for the life of the object provided by the DLL.</p>
