requires the use of good object-oriented software design principles.</p>
<div id="GUID-97EC594D-ECF5-4BCA-A9D8-C7F19C7E8673"><h3 class="section-title">Background</h3><p>This document assumes you have some basic knowledge of Symbian
C++ programming. Essential information about Symbian C++ can be found
in <a href="GUID-C3206E31-251C-4AFC-90C2-04B38CCF8E18.html">Introduction
to Symbian C++ development</a>.</p> <p>Many of the device
services provided on Symbian are available to your Qt applications
through the Qt Mobility APIs and so some of your applications may
not need to contain any Symbian C++ code. However, some Symbian device
services and features are not accessible by using Qt and Qt Mobility
APIs. To access these, you must use native Symbian C++ code. This
document describes a design pattern for using Qt and Symbian C++ code
together in a Qt application. </p><p>The essential rule is: do not
mix Qt and Symbian C++ code in the same source file. The programming
idioms for Qt and Symbian C++ are very different and you should not
mix them. Ideally, write your application modules using Qt, and use
native Symbian C++ code only where necessary. Provide clean interfaces
between your Qt code and your Symbian C++ code. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-05559A57-41E3-4322-A270-69E745741950"><h3 class="section-title">Separating
Qt and Symbian C++</h3><p>If Qt does not provide an API for a feature
or service that is available on a specific platform, the recommended
way to access that service is to write a generic, cross-platform wrapper
API and provide a private platform specific implementation of that
API for each target platform. By isolating platform-specific code
behind an interface, you can prevent widespread platform dependencies
in your code. This facilitates porting applications that use the feature
between different platforms. Using this approach, you can write most
of your application code in the easy-to-use Qt programming idioms,
and confine the platform specific code to individual code modules.
This is the technique that Qt uses to abstract the underlying operating
system so that developers do not need to be aware of each platform's
native programming idioms, APIs, installation mechanisms, build systems
and limitations. </p><p>There are a number of different design patterns
you could use to structure your code. In this document we discuss
the PIMPL (Pointer to Implementation) design pattern, in which platform-specific
implementations are hidden behind a private pointer in a public API.
PIMPL has a number of different names in design pattern literature,
including "Handle-Body", "Compiler Firewall", "the Bridge", "Opaque
Pointers", and "Cheshire Cat".</p><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>You can use other design
patterns and techniques in your code. For example, in Qt most of the <code class="codeph">QPixmap</code> API is implemented in a common source file, but <code class="codeph">QPixmap::grabWindow()</code> is implemented in platform-specific
source files. This approach is acceptable provided the platform-specific
implementation is not exposed by the public Qt API.</p></div></div><p>Accessing device-specific features on Symbian is not simply a
matter of using standard C++ APIs and idioms to call device-specific
APIs. Symbian's native programming language is Symbian C++, a variant
of C++ that evolved specifically to address the needs of resource
constrained devices. Symbian C++ uses programming idioms and frameworks
that promote robust and memory efficient code, but sometimes at the
expense of ease of use. Symbian C++ has its own exception handling
mechanism, and omits standard C and C++ libraries that were not available
when it was first created, or were considered too resource-intensive.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-B06721DB-3054-41A6-B962-9BA36323329F"><h3 class="section-title">The
Pointer to Implementation Pattern (PIMPL)</h3><p>PIMPL is a variant
of the Handle-Body design pattern, in which a public API class contains
a pointer to a private implementation class. The private implementation
class is forward declared (instead of using <code class="codeph">#include</code>) in the header file, and is therefore hidden to clients of the public
API.</p><p>If the implementation class must call methods in the public
class we can pass a pointer or reference to the public class in the
implementation class's constructor.</p><p>If the implementation class
needs to call private methods on the public class (for example, in
order to emit signals to public API clients) you can make the implementation
class a friend of the public class. The class diagram shown below
illustrates the relationships between classes, showing a public API
class <code class="codeph">QMyClass</code> which owns a private implementation
class <code class="codeph">QMyClassPrivate</code>.</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-E0A2F7EA-779C-40A8-8CDD-A265AE21EB92"><img src="GUID-E1EBD305-95FF-49F9-8CB6-BB6F997DC90E_d0e15339_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>Public API and private implementation classes.</p></div><p>The implementation of <code class="codeph">QMyClass</code> creates and
destroys the private implementation <code class="codeph">QMyClassPrivate</code>. In order to do this, <code class="codeph">QMyClass</code> must have the definition
of <code class="codeph">QMyClassPrivate</code> and so the <code class="codeph">QMyClass</code> source file must <code class="codeph">#include</code> the <code class="codeph">QMyClassPrivate</code> header files for the different target platforms. This can be achieved
by using platform specific <code class="codeph">#define</code> statements to
support conditional compilation for different platforms. Qt defines <code class="codeph">Q_OS_SYMBIAN</code> (in <code>qglobal.h</code>) which can
be used in your application to conditionally compile Symbian-specific
code. </p><pre class="codeblock">// In fictional myclass.cpp
...
#ifdef Q_OS_SYMBIAN
#include "qmyclass_symbian.h"   // Symbian definition of private class
#else
#include "qmyclass_stub.h"      // Stub for all other platforms
#endif
...</pre><p>The definition and implementation of your private
class implementations are almost entirely up to you. The only real
constraint is that you must use the same private implementation class
name for all of your target platforms (otherwise you would need to
include separate forward definitions and friend declarations in your
public API header file for each platform). Also, typically all of
your private classes for the different target platforms should expose
the same function names to the public API class – this simplifies
the implementation of the public class.</p><pre class="codeblock">// Implementation of a public class slot mySlot() is defined on all
// private implementation classes for different target platforms and
// so can be called in the same way from the QMyClass public API class.
void QMyClass::mySlot()
{
    d_ptr-&gt;mySlot();
}</pre><p>A private implementation class can derive from any
base class. Although it is common for implementation classes to be
derived from <code class="codeph">QObject</code>, this is not a requirement (although
it is necessary if you want your implementation to have signals or
slots). Qt code often uses <code class="codeph">QObjectPrivate</code> for private
implementations. This is not part of the public Qt APIs and you should
not use it in your own application code. </p><p>For private implementations
written in Symbian C++ there are two basic class designs:</p><ul>
<li><p>Private implementation class is-a <code class="codeph">CBase</code> .</p></li>
<li><p>Private implementation class uses-a <code class="codeph">CBase</code> and
implements a callback interface. </p></li>
</ul><p>The following diagram shows a private implementation class
that is-a <code class="codeph">CActive</code> (<code class="codeph">CActive</code> derives
from <code class="codeph">CBase</code>).</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-05B3B656-C31F-4B75-B279-94E125AB8C83"><img src="GUID-BB5115CD-02F3-4732-B62C-21583C1A1DF8_d0e15421_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>Private implementation class is-a CActive</p></div><p>The following diagram shows a private implementation class
that uses-a <code class="codeph">CBase</code> and implements a callback interface.</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-0E851D18-FB0E-4DFF-B3BE-7A645FFFACAB"><img src="GUID-8D619A1C-989B-40C3-AD32-B0AE38629F1C_d0e15433_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>Private implementation class uses-a CBase </p></div><p>The “is a <code class="codeph">CBase</code>” design requires less programming
effort, because you do not need an additional level of indirection
to create and use the Symbian class, or to get notification of asynchronous
function call completions through a callback interface. This is a
good design choice if you only need to use asynchronous function calls
onto a single Symbian C++ class, in which case you can often make
the private class a <code class="codeph">CActive</code> (which derives from <code class="codeph">CBase</code>). One disadvantage of the “is a <code class="codeph">CBase</code>” design is that code to construct the private implementation class
is a little more complex and it may be more difficult to conceptually
separate Qt and Symbian C++ code. The Dialpad example code, which
is described in the following sections uses a private implementation
class derived from <code class="codeph">CActive</code>. </p><p>Using the “has
a <code class="codeph">CBase</code>” design results in a cleaner separation between
the Qt and Symbian programming idioms. It is also a better solution
if your implementation needs to use several Symbian classes. The Callback
APIs section in <a href="GUID-1D726592-A754-4212-B77D-54A1168403A8.html">Converting Active Objects to Signals &amp; Slots</a> explains
this design pattern in more detail. </p></div>

class <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate</code> defined in files <code class="codeph">telephony_symbian.h</code> (for Symbian) and <code class="codeph">telephony_stub.h</code> (a dummy implementation). </p><p>The two private classes share the same name and have a superset
of the public class slots and methods. Note that they do not re-implement
the public API class's signals: they can cause the public API class
to emit signals by calling <code class="codeph">emit</code> on the public class
pointer they get on construction. </p><pre class="codeblock">/*

Symbian class implementation is not visible in the public API. As
a general rule, however, it is better to put as much of the platform-specific
implementation as possible into the private class. </p><p>Function <code class="codeph">NewL()</code> is a standard Symbian static factory class for creating
new objects. It is implemented by <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate</code> to ensure that the object is either fully allocated, or is properly
cleaned up in the event of a problem. Because <code class="codeph">NewL()</code> can leave, it must be wrapped in a <code class="codeph">QT_TRAP_THROWING</code> macro to convert the leave into a standard C++ throw. The document <a href="GUID-05D2DFDE-FDCE-457E-8714-2315F1069B48.html">Exceptions &amp;
Error Handling</a> explains how to create exception handling barriers
between Symbian and Qt code. </p><p>If you implement the private class
using the “has-a <code class="codeph">CBase</code>” design instead, constructing

QT_TRAP_THROWING(symbianMember = CTelephonyManager::NewL(this));
}</pre><p>There are other strategies for allocating the Symbian
object in your code. Whatever method you use, the important things
to remember are: </p><ul>
<li><p>Symbian C classes have their <code class="codeph">new</code> function
overloaded from <code class="codeph">CBase</code> and it does not <code class="codeph">throw</code> exceptions. If you construct your private implementation class using <code class="codeph">new</code>, you must use the <code class="codeph">q_check_ptr()</code> function
to check the returned pointer and throw if it is <code class="codeph">Null</code>. </p><p>This is important if a CBase-derived object is not initialized
until it is first used. You can construct the object using <code class="codeph">new</code>, but you must check the pointer before you use it for
object initialization and throw if it is NULL. </p></li>
<li><p>It is your responsibility to ensure that the object is properly
cleaned up if its construction fails. </p><p>This is important because
it is not always obvious whether cleanup will occur properly, particularly
when mixing Qt and Symbian C++ idioms. Consider the following code: </p><pre class="codeblock">Telephony::Telephony(QObject *parent)
: QObject(parent)
{  
d_ptr = q_check_ptr(new TelephonyPrivate(this));  //from Qt 4.6
#ifdef Q_OS_SYMBIAN
QT_TRAP_THROWING(d_ptr-&gt;ConstructL());
#endif
}</pre><p>If <code class="codeph">ConstructL()</code> leaves, the macro
throws. Following normal C++ rules, the memory for <code class="codeph">Telephony</code> is freed but the destructor is not called. Therefore any partially
allocated objects in <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate</code> will leak memory.
For this to work correctly <code class="codeph">d_ptr</code>  would need to be
a smart pointer (<code class="codeph">QScopedPointer</code>). </p><p>The public
class must delete the private implementation in its destructor.</p></li>
</ul><div class="p">The public API methods are replicated in the private class.
Public methods call the equivalent private class methods through the

convert to and from a <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-683A1D42-2764-3EB7-BD19-9E12559199AB.html#GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-683A1D42-2764-3EB7-BD19-9E12559199AB.html"><code class="apiname">CFbsBitmap</code></a>: <ul>
<li><code class="codeph">CFbsBitmap * QPixmap::toSymbianCFbsBitmap () const</code></li>
<li><code class="codeph">static QPixmap QPixmap::fromSymbianCFbsBitmap ( CFbsBitmap
* bitmap )</code></li>
</ul></div><p>Similarly, it is sometimes necessary to reveal platform-specific
types and publicly include platform headers in order to map them to
generic typedefs. This can be seen in <code class="codeph">QProcess</code> where <code class="codeph">Q_PID</code> is a typedef to a Symbian <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-2B5DA16C-3FBA-36CE-8821-E68B1BE45B9F.html#GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-2B5DA16C-3FBA-36CE-8821-E68B1BE45B9F.html"><code class="apiname">TProcessId</code></a>. </p><div class="p">In all cases, platform-specific artifacts should be defined
to be visible only in the specific platform. For example, from the <code class="codeph">QPixmap</code> declaration: <pre class="codeblock">#if defined(Q_OS_SYMBIAN)
CFbsBitmap *toSymbianCFbsBitmap() const;
static QPixmap fromSymbianCFbsBitmap(CFbsBitmap *bitmap);
#endif</pre></div></div>
