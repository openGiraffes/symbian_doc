<p><a href="GUID-5F38F219-B22D-42E6-973A-B4DBBC5984F8.html">Digital
rights management</a> (DRM) refers to any of several encryption
technologies used to protect digital media (such as audio, video and
images) against unauthorized copying, and to control the distribution
of the content. It allows the development of new end-user features
and new kinds of mobile content services for content providers, service
developers, operators, and service providers. Symbian applications
can recognize DRM protected media objects and customize the user interface
accordingly. All functions are visible for DRM content, but when the
user selects the function, its use might be prevented or constrained.
The applications also ensure that the security of DRM protected media
is not compromised in any situation, for example during temporary
saving. </p>
<p>DRM adds value for all parties who have an interest in content
businesses. For content owners, it allows them to make efficient use
of digital distribution channels. In agreement with their distributors,
DRM also allows content owners to decide which rights to give to content
users and which business models to adopt, including new models of
renting and superdistribution. Additionally, DRM can significantly
improve the mobile user experience by providing new content and allowing
free previews before buying.</p>
<p>You can agree with business partners, such as content owners
and service providers who provide the content management and delivery
platform, which of their content services to apply OMA DRM to, and
what kind of usage rights to assign to them. In the simplest case,
they can have all of their content files packaged in OMA forward-lock
format. Alternatively, they can also apply user rights to promote
various business models as part of their content services. </p>

technologies.</p>
