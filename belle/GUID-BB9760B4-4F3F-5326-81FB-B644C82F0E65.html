data through file systems. Drives and file systems are common resources
used by many programs, and access to them is managed by the <em>File

media on a phone can use different types of file system to organise
files. Symbian platform provides a number of types of file system.
You can implement a new file system in a type of DLL called a file
system plug-in. You can also implement DLLs called a file server extensions
to change the behaviour of a file system. You can implement a DLL
called a file server plug-in to extend the behaviour of the File Server
itself. </p>
<p>The File Server is started by the Base Starter component. The configuration
of the File Server, such as which file systems are loaded to which
drives, is done in the Base Starter configuration file. </p>
