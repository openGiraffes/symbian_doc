This is represented in timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is in seconds relative to 0h UTC on 1 January 1900. This is used in combination with timestamps returned in reception reports from other receivers to measure round-trip propagation to those receivers. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">RTPTimeStamp</code>: Gets the RTP time when this packet was sent. RTP time is profile dependant. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">ByteCount</code>: Gets the number of bytes sent. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">PacketCount</code>: Gets the total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender from the start of the transmission until the time this SR packet was generated. You must reset the count if the sender changes its SSRC identifier. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">Extension</code>: Retrieves an extension defined for SR packets (also for RR packets) for any additional information to be reported about sender or receiver. </p> <p> <strong>Note:</strong> <code class="codeph">RRtcpSRPart</code> does not have a close function as the resources accessed through this handle are owned by object of <code class="codeph">RRtpReceiveSource</code>. </p> </div> <div><h3 class="section-title">Receiving reports</h3> <p>To know how the data packets are being sent to the host, feedback is required from the receiving hosts. <code class="codeph">RRtcpRRItem</code> supports you in getting this information as receiving reports. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">RRtcpRRPart</code> provides a list of the receipt reports (RR) from the receiving hosts reporting on the send stream. You can also create an RR object by calling <code class="codeph">RRtpSession::GetRRs()</code>. </p> <p>To get a specific receive report of a host, call the index operator <code class="codeph">RRtcpRRPart::operator[]</code>. This returns an object of <code class="codeph">RRtcpRRItem</code>. You can get the total number of receive reports received by calling <code class="codeph">RRtcpRRPart::Count</code>. </p> <p>You can get the following information from a receiver report to assess the quality of the service: </p> <p> <code class="codeph">SenderSSRC</code>: Gets the sender’s 32-bit numeric synchronisation source identifier. The same is updated in the member table. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">AboutSSRC</code>: Gets the SSRC related to the current packet. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">PacketsLost</code>: Returns the total number of RTP packets lost from source SSRC since the beginning of the reception. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">FractionLost</code>: Returns the fraction of RTP data packets from the source SSRC lost since the previous SR or RR packet was sent. This is the integer part of the product of loss fraction and 256 (loss fraction x 256). </p> <p> <code class="codeph">ExtendedHighestSequenceNumber</code>: Gets the extended highest sequence number received in an RTP data packet from the source. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">DelaySinceLastSR</code>: Gets the time elapsed from the receipt of the last SR (Sender Report) and the time when current reception report packet was sent. The delay time is expressed in 1/65536 seconds. If no SR packet has been received yet from SSRC, the DLSR field is set to zero. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">InterarrivalJitter</code>: Gets the variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time, measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer. This gives the measure of network congestion. </p> <p> <code class="codeph">LastSRTimestamp</code>: Gets NTP timestamp of the most recent RTCP sender report (SR) packet from source SSRC. If no SR has been received, the field is set to zero. </p> <p>All the preceding information about the data sent to the receiving hosts is used to modify the transmission and also to determine if the problem is local, regional or global. </p> </div> <div><h3 class="section-title">See also</h3> <p><a href="GUID-FBA52F3B-0A7A-5FE3-82CD-72F88788D432.html#GUID-352B33B6-D02B-5ECB-B154-6CB06C21A377">Types of RTCP packets</a> </p> <p><a href="GUID-0ACAFB87-0D45-5BAA-B40A-9A7DC1646B01.html#GUID-663C6781-3137-5D48-A836-6ADDD4474805">Sending various RTCP packets</a> </p> </div> </div></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="metadata">Last updated November 3rd, 2009</p><hr /><div class="copy">© Nokia 2012.</div></div></body>
