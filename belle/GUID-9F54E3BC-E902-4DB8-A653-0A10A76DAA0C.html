<div id="GUID-352AD9DD-435B-44DA-A509-35AEB3706871"><h3 class="section-title">Localization</h3><p>Localization is the adaptation of software to meet the requirements
of local markets and various languages. Often localization is only
seen as translation, but it also ensures the correctness of cultural
and linguistic conventions used.</p><p>Successful localization requires
support for translators: this can be done during the translation phase
by advising the translators, or by creating the software in a way
that takes localization into account. This is often called internationalization.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-441EC961-0465-4C93-8930-3C63BE2A4D0B"><h3 class="section-title">Internationalization</h3><p>On Symbian platform, internationalization is a mind-set and architectural
issue. The goal is to separate application code into a) the non-changing
core that contains all the functionality and b) the changing content
that contains the culturally sensitive data, such as text strings
on the UI. Most of the functionality that you will need is offered
by Qt/QML, and you should separate the UI texts into <code>.ts</code> resource files.</p><p>Internationalization deals with variety of
issues: character sets, sorting order and so on.</p><p>When done successfully,
multiple language variants can efficiently be created in the localization
phase from this single, internationalized source, with minimal involvement
from the source creator – you.</p><p>In application internationalization,
you should rely mostly on Qt internationalization guidance. The Symbian
platform also offers some APIs that can be utilized.</p><p>Internationalization
is most useful when you are aiming to make multiple language variants,
or intend the application to have a long life span. If your application
is aimed for one extra language, or one version only, internationalization
might be unnecessary.</p></div>
