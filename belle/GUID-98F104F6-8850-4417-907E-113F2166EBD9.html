<p>Increasingly sophisticated mobile software has improved features
and intelligence in mobile devices. At the same time, the increasing
volume of high-end mobile devices has shaped the profile of an average
user from an IT professional to an average-skilled end user.</p>
<p>This shift has created new opportunities for malicious parties
who usually want to gain access to the valuable information stored
in mobile devices.</p>
<div id="GUID-1F289359-8538-4352-AD30-DB83C0779E9C"><h3 class="section-title">Types
of threats</h3>
<p>The following list classifies threats according to the most
common reasons for security breaches, in descending order of frequency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentional hostile action, where an attacker is
deliberately trying to harm the system</p></li>
<li><p>Administrative flaws in the management of a device
(for example, in a security area)</p></li>
<li><p>User mistakes, such as deletion of critical information
or typing errors</p></li>
<li><p>Technical failures that cause data corruption, deletion,
or inaccessibility</p></li>
<li><p>Other unpredictable or unavoidable failures and incidents
that cannot be prevented (usually system wide)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="GUID-2FE0C29F-FC65-49A7-9F51-79847232C991"><h3 class="section-title">Types
of malicious software </h3>
<p>There are different types of malicious software that you need
to be aware of when designing new applications. The following common
classification is based on the way these programs spread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Software that needs a host to spread:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Backdoors and trapdoors</em> are debug-type entrances
to programs, for example, via hard-coded password access.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Logical bomb</em> "explodes" under certain conditions,
that is, it stops working or corrupts data. Like backdoors, the logical
bombs can be unintentional, there may be a bug in the application
that the developer did not discover in the testing phase.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Trojan horse</em> is a useful-looking software
that acts maliciously without notifying the user.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Virus</em> modifies other software to reproduce
new viruses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Software that spreads independently:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Bacteria</em> (also known as <em> rabbits</em>) reproduce
themselves as quickly as possible to jam the system and its services.
A single unit of bacteria is not usually dangerous, the strength comes
from a large quantity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Worm</em> spreads through networks and can act
in a system like bacteria or a virus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These classifications are not strict or self-contained. For
example, a worm can be used to install a Trojan horse into a system.
The Trojan horse can then be used to activate a backdoor or logical
bomb.</p>
<p>Controlling and restricting the access rights to your soft ware
is an effective precaution to protect the system against these malicious
programs. From Symbian OS v9.1, onwards, control and authentication
of access rights is performed by the <a href="GUID-4BFEDD79-9502-526A-BA7B-97550A6F0601.html">platform security</a> mechanisms.</p>
