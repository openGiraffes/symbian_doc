options for Qt mobile applications</h3><p>The cross-platform application
development framework of Qt offers a wide variety of techniques for
designing and implementing the UI for your mobile application. They
cater for various kinds of applications and use cases. You can also
mix the techniques to create the UI required.</p><p>For more details

<div id="GUID-9745E017-DFB8-44BF-B92C-FC8328CDDEE1"><h3 class="section-title">Designing
mobile applications</h3><p>Before starting application development,
analyze and define the requirements, scope, and functionality of the
application to ensure efficient functionality and a smooth user experience.
Design the application for a single purpose and analyze how it can
best serve its users. Mobile devices have been designed for use on
the go. Keep the characteristics of mobile devices in mind when you
design applications for them.</p><p>For more in-depth guidelines on
design and usability, refer <a href="http://library.forum.nokia.com/topic/Design_and_User_Experience_Library/GUID-A8DF3EB8-E97C-4DA0-95F6-F464ECC995BC_cover.html" target="_blank">Design and User Experience Library</a> on Nokia
