and line breaking. Languages based on the Latin script are fairly
simple to handle, as words are separated by a space, and you can break
a line at a space, tab, or hyphen. However, in languages such as Thai
and Khmer, words run together with no space in between.</p>
<p>Languages can have their own rules for line breaking and word wrapping.
Symbian uses the defined legal combinations of characters to apply
line breaking.</p>
<div id="GUID-B5DD7146-7675-4EC4-9776-F5E25503BE14-GENID-GUID-CCE1E77B-473A-46CA-BFA4-24EBB8DC3C45"><h3 class="section-title">Wordjoiner (WORDJOINER: U+2060)</h3>
<p>Wordjoiner
is a character that is used to manually override word breaks. The
wordjoiner has no width so it is not visible in the UI. The function
of the character is to indicate that line breaks are not allowed between
the adjoining characters.</p><p>In other words, wordjoiner prevents
a break at a position. In Thai language, it has been used as a quick
fix to correct line wrapping in the rare occasions where the zero-width
space character does not work.</p><p>Word Joiner (WJ) can be used
to glue characters together.</p><p>When using QML, the "wrap mode"
property affects how the wrapping is performed. "Word wrap" and "No
wrap" are the wrap modes which respect the WJ. Other wrap modes override
the WJ. "Word wrap" can be used with all languages. See the enumeration <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qml-text.html#wrapMode-prop">wrapMode</a>.</p><p>There are currently differences between languages
how the wrapping is performed. For example, wrapping with WJ works
differently for Thai than for Chinese. In Thai the Zero-width space
(ZWS) is used to separate words. With Chinese, ZWS has no real use.
Chinese can use WJ if needed to glue glyphs together. Wrapping of
"dot" character (U+3302 in Unicode) is handled automatically in QML,
no WJ is needed.  </p><p><strong>Word Joiner example — Case 1: Thai</strong></p><p><strong>Logical name</strong>: qtn_err_wlan_sc_config_failed_try_again/errorres</p><p><strong>English</strong>: WLAN configuration failed. Try again.</p><p><strong>Thai translation</strong>: การ\u200Bกำหนด\u200Bค่า WLAN ล้มเหลว ลอง\u200Bอีก\u200Bครั้ง</p> <p>Notice that in the Thai translation the zero width space
character (\u200B) has been used to indicate the correct place for
a word break. However, since the translation contains Latin characters,
the zero-width space does not function. The text is still incorrectly
wrapped in the UI, so wordjoiner is used to correctly wrap the translation.</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-2E27E4E6-59C0-4F16-B6E1-B1102C7C28BF"><img src="GUID-7AAAA703-93A2-48F4-B739-78A27790E6AD_d0e22211_href.png" /></div><p>การกำหนดค่า WLAN <strong>ล้มเ</strong>หลว ลองอีกครั้ง </p><p>If we
want "<strong>ล้มเ</strong>" to be in same line we have to add wordjoiner between <strong>ล้</strong> and <strong>ม</strong> and also between <strong>ม</strong> and <strong>เ</strong>, just
to make sure that the whole word sticks together.</p><p>So result
would be (□ represents wordjoiner):</p><p>การกำหนดค่า <strong>WLAN</strong> </p><p>ล้□ม□เหลว ลองอีกครั้ง  </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-B5DD7146-7675-4EC4-9776-F5E25503BE14-GENID-GUID-CCE1E77B-473A-46CA-BFA4-24EBB8DC3C45"><h3 class="section-title">Zero-width space (ZWSP : U+200B)</h3>
<p>Zero-width space indicates a word boundary and just as wordjoiner,
it has no width and is thus not visible in the UI. It is used in languages
such as Thai that have no visible word spacing to represent word breaks.</p><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong> The zero-width space does not work if the text contains
Latin characters. This applies to Thai language. In these occasions,
please use also wordjoiner to correct the text.</p></div></div>
</div>
<div id="GUID-B5DD7146-7675-4EC4-9776-F5E25503BE14-GENID-GUID-CCE1E77B-473A-46CA-BFA4-24EBB8DC3C45"><h3 class="section-title">Forced line feed (Forced line feed: \n)</h3>
<p>Forced line feed character has been used in Symbian localization
in the past as an easy fix for incorrectly wrapped texts. However,
its use is not recommended.</p><p>Forced line feed is problematic,
since it overrides the line wrapper and forces the line to break at
a certain point. Since we support two display resolutions, QVGA and
QHD, forced line feed causes problems. The text might be correctly
wrapped in QVGA but not in QHD resolutions after adding a forced line
feed, and that would generate unnecessary errors.</p><p><strong>Forced
line feed example — Case 2: Japanese</strong></p><p><strong>Logical name</strong>: qtn_smsvo_invalid_number/vmbx</p><p><strong>English</strong>: Invalid call
mailbox number</p><p><strong>Japanese translation</strong>: 留守番電話セン<strong>\n</strong>ターの番号が正しくありません</p><p> The text is incorrectly wrapped since "ー" is
not allowed at the beginning of the line in Japanese and to avoid
the situation, the forced line feed character (<strong>\n</strong>) has been
inserted before ”タ" to correct the situation. However, since the translations
should support both QVGA and QHD displays, the solution is not sufficient.</p><p>The text is correctly wrapped in QVGA but not in QHD where there
is an unnecessary empty space. The forced line feed character has
to be removed and replaced with the wordjoiner character since the
wordjoiner character can be used whether the device is in whichever
mode.</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-D6F4BB2E-4A3E-43E4-A0AA-27CCF9F5518D"><img src="GUID-9FBF6F2C-86C3-41F1-9273-22B79BE1EF37_d0e22295_href.png" /></div><p>留守番電話セン<strong>\n</strong>ターの番号が正しくありません</p><p>The forced line feed
character, \n, has to be removed before "ター" and the wordjoiner character
added between “タ” and “ー". After the wordjoiner has been added, the
characters before and after it stick together.</p><p>So result would
be (□ represents wordjoiner):</p><p>留守番電話センタ□ーの</p><p>番号が正しくありませ</p><p>ん</p><p><strong>Forced line feed example — Case 3: Chinese</strong></p><p><strong>Logical name:</strong> qtn_bt_block_all_conn_attempts/btnotif</p><p><strong>English:</strong> Block all future connection requests from %U?</p><p><strong>Chinese translation:</strong>  禁止%U以后发来的所有连接<strong>\n</strong>请求？</p><p>Again,
the text is incorrectly wrapped and the forced line feed character
(<strong>\n</strong>) has been inserted to correct the situation. It has not
helped, so it has to be removed and the wordjoiner inserted to wrap
the text correctly.</p><div class="figure" id="GUID-C3480B22-301B-4758-85DE-19A5ECD58526"><img src="GUID-2456806C-D773-41E2-8F0D-B121E84291EF_d0e22338_href.png" /></div><p>禁止%U以后发来的所有连接<strong>\n</strong>请求？</p><p>So the forced line feed character,
\n, is removed before "请" and the wordjoiner character added between
“求” and “？" to prevent the question mark from appearing alone at the
beginning of a line.</p><p>So result would be (□ represents wordjoiner):</p><p> 禁止%U以后发来的所有</p><p>连接请求⁠？</p> </div>
<div id="GUID-B5DD7146-7675-4EC4-9776-F5E25503BE14-GENID-GUID-CCE1E77B-473A-46CA-BFA4-24EBB8DC3C45"><h3 class="section-title">Using unicode characters for text wrapping</h3>
<p>Problem with Thai, Japanese and Chinese is that usually
there are no spaces in translations and thus linewrapper doesn't know
from where to break the text to the next line. Usually it breaks only
in case of space or other wrapping point.</p><p>In Symbian localization
for Thai, the text wrapping has been corrected by adding zero width
space characters to appropriate places to ensure that the text is
correctly wrapped and breaks only at the specified places. For Japanese
and Chinese, the use of the zero width space is not recommended. </p><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>If you see one of these special characters in the text mass,
please do not remove them.</p></div></div> </div>
