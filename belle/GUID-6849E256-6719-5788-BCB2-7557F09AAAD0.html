<p>User Prompt Service (UPS) configuration component (<code class="codeph">\securityconfig\ups\</code>) includes a <code>backup.xml</code> file and a ROM stub
SIS file for configuring a UPS policy file. Device creators must modify
the configuration files of UPS and rebuild the <code>securityconfig</code> component, to customise the behavior of the UPS component. </p>
<div id="GUID-753A73C1-F1BC-4A8D-8A79-2FD53AF2B4E4"><h3 class="section-title"> Introduction</h3> <p>UPS policy files are resource files that specify whether application
requests to access services are silently accepted or denied or whether
they require the user to be prompted. Each service has a policy file.
The policy file lists policies for various applications. The configuration
of policy file involves configuring ROM stub package file and backup
XML file.  </p> </div>

and Configuring UPS Policy file</h3> <p><strong>Installing policy files</strong> </p> <p>A policy file on the system drive eclipses a policy file
on the Z drive if it has the same filename. If the policy file on
the system drive is corrupt, the policy file on the Z drive (if it
exists) is used instead. The policy files should be installed (and
upgraded) through Software Install to the private directory of the
UPS on the system drive. The private directory is <code>\private\10283558\policies</code>. </p> <p><strong>Upgrading package file</strong> </p> <p>The SIS file must
either contain the executable or be an upgrade to the base package
which supplied the executable, for delivering files into the private
directory of an executable. </p> <p>The following is a default implementation
of a package file for UPS server ROM stub SIS file: </p> <pre class="codeblock">; Package file for User Prompt Service server ROM stub SIS file
