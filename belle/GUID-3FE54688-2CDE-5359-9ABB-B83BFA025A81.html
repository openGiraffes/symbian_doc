controls and non-window-owning controls</h1><div>
<p>Controls are similar to windows in the Window Server in that they are both
bounded areas of the screen and both user interface elements. They are not
synonymous, however, as a control may take up the whole of a window’s area
or only part of it. For this reason controls are divided into two types: window-owning
controls and non-window-owning controls. </p>
<div id="GUID-A9A8EEB4-2E5D-4926-97C7-33A1A0CF67CB"><h3 class="section-title">Window-owning controls</h3> <p>A window-owning control
has the same size and position as a window in the Window Server. Window-owning
controls may overlap each other and may be moved around the screen within
the bounds of their parent window. Dialogs, menus, toolbars and <em>top-level
controls</em> are typically window-owning controls. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-E0C33F8A-9A4A-4953-A57C-E96921290086"><h3 class="section-title">Non-window-owning controls (lodger controls)</h3> <p>The
majority of controls are non-window-owning. A non-window-owning control’s <em>extent</em> typically
covers only part of a window on the screen: usually it is one of a number
of controls within a larger <em>compound control</em> which acts
as a container. </p> <p>Examples of non-window-owning controls include command
buttons, text boxes and labels. </p> <p>Non-window-owning controls give greater
efficiency as they require fewer resources in the Window Server and fewer
process switches. They can also result in faster intialisation and redrawing
because a compound control and all its non-window-owning components can be
drawn with a single flush to the window server. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-22B830AC-D43C-4FB6-9C5D-1F89AD65EF8F"><h3 class="section-title">Associated windows</h3> <p>All controls have an <em>associated
window</em>, whether they are window-owning or not. For a window-owning
control the associated window is the window it owns. For a non-window-owning
control the associated window is the window owned by the nearest window-owning
control above it in the control hierarchy. </p> </div>
