technologies whose primary function is to control application access
to data and system services.</p>
<p>Platform security gives the user confidence that an application
can only do the things it claims it needs to do. For example, a simple
game may be refused network access or access to a user’s personal
data.</p>
<div class="p">There are three interrelated components of platform security:<ol>
<li id="GUID-9B2854C8-395E-463D-87A4-739322128102"><a name="GUID-9B2854C8-395E-463D-87A4-739322128102"><!-- --></a><p>The capability
model: this says that every process on the device runs with a set
of capabilities. Access to certain system services and resources is
only permitted by processes that possess specific capabilities. </p></li>
<li id="GUID-32B0E14C-028B-46B7-B43D-089F13995373"><a name="GUID-32B0E14C-028B-46B7-B43D-089F13995373"><!-- --></a><p>Process identity: </p><ul>
<li><p>Every independently certified EXE on the device has a globally
unique secure identifier. All servers are able to examine the identifier
of their client processes, so a server may know exactly which EXE
is requesting a given service. </p></li>
<li><p>Every independently certified EXE on the device may have a
vendor identifier that securely identifies the organization that created
it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li id="GUID-1B15B224-929C-4961-845A-FA14EB136C0E"><a name="GUID-1B15B224-929C-4961-845A-FA14EB136C0E"><!-- --></a><p>Data caging:
different parts of the file system are restricted, so only processes
with specific capability sets, or secure identifiers, can read and/or
write particular directories.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<div id="GUID-DC82C683-4BB9-4A64-896E-974AAB812B05"><h3 class="section-title">User
and system capabilities</h3><p>Every binary in the system has a
capability field that defines the capabilities it has requested at
build time. The capability field is a bitfield in which each bit represents
a single capability. Each capability is logically independent of all
the others, so having any one capability does not imply ownership
of any other, and there is no logical hierarchy of capabilities.</p><p>Capabilities are divided into user and system capabilities. User
capabilities are designed to be meaningful to the end user. They are
defined for activities that could cost the user money (such as using
the network) or violate their privacy (such as accessing the address
book). Users can be given the option to grant these capabilities to
an application.</p><p>The list of user capabilities can vary depending
on the specific security policy chosen by the device manufacturer,
but the following capabilities are typically user grantable:</p><ul>
<li><p>NetworkServices: the ability to make phone calls, send e-mails,
and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>LocalServices: the ability to use short-link network services
such as Bluetooth.</p></li>
<li><p>ReadUserData: the ability to read the user’s private data.</p></li>
<li><p>WriteUserData: the ability to modify or create the user’s private
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Location: get access to the device’s location.</p></li>
<li><p>UserEnvironment: access to information about the user’s environment,
including the ability to record audio and use the camera.</p></li>
</ul><p>System capabilities are not expected to be meaningful to the
end user, so users are not given the option to grant them. Some system
capabilities allow access to services at a lower level than user capabilities,
thereby providing backdoor access to activities already protected
by a user capability. For example, direct access to comms device drivers
could provide a backdoor to access the network, and direct access
to application private data could provide a backdoor to access user
data. Additional capabilities are defined for activities that could
affect the integrity of the system as a whole, and for certain other
quite specialized activities such as digital rights management.</p><div class="p">A subset of system capabilities is given below:<ul>
<li><p>ReadDeviceData: the ability to read system settings (such as
IAP settings).</p></li>
<li><p>WriteDeviceData: the ability to modify or create system settings.</p></li>
<li><p>CommDD: access to communication device drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>DRM: access to content protected by some form of digital rights
management.</p></li>
<li><p>AllFiles: read access to all file system, and write access
to application private data.</p></li>
<li><p>TCB: read and write access to the part of the file system where
binaries are stored. TCB stands for 'trusted computing base'. The
TCB capability enables the code possessing it to assign any set of
capabilities to any binary on the device. So TCB-capable code is able
to subvert the whole security model, and must be trusted to the highest
degree.</p></li>
</ul><strong>Capability example</strong></div><p>Most capability checks take place
when an application makes a request of a server. The server can find
out the capabilities of their clients, and use this to decide whether
or not to service a request. This decision can sometimes depend on
the values of the request parameters, as in the following code fragment
that creates a file server session and attempts to read from the z:\sys
directory.</p><pre class="codeblock">// Create a file server session.
RFs fs;
User::LeaveIfError( fs.Connect() );

// Add the session to the cleanup stack
// before calling a leaving function.
CleanupClosePushL( fs );

// Retrieve information about directory contents into a CDir object.
// The call to GetDir() instantiates the CDir.
_LIT( KDirectory, "Z:\\sys" );
CDir* dir = 0;
User::LeaveIfError( fs.GetDir(KDirectory, KEntryAttMaskSupported, ESortNone, dir) );

// Add the CDir to the cleanup stack.
CleanupStack::PushL( dir );

// Use the CDir to retrieve information about
// the directory contents.
...

// Clean up.
CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( 2, &amp;fs );</pre><div class="p">As \sys is
a protected directory this code will fail the file server's capability
check if it is run from an application without the AllFiles capability.
The server will complete the request with a <code class="codeph">KErrPermissionDenied</code> error code (-46). To resolve the error you request the AllFiles
capability in the application's project file (.pro):<pre class="codeblock">symbian {
   ...
   TARGET.CAPABILITY += AllFiles
}</pre>The requested capability is not user grantable, so the
application developer needs to interact with the <a href="http://www.symbiansigned.com/" target="_blank">Symbian Signed</a> certification process.</div><p><strong>DLL capabilities</strong></p><p>DLLs
also have capabilities, represented in the same way and referring
to the same privileges. Note that the capabilities of a DLL do not
affect the capabilities of the process that loads it: process capabilities
are entirely defined by the capabilities of the EXE.</p><p>The rule
for DLL capabilities is: a binary cannot load any DLL that has fewer
capabilities than itself. This ensures an EXE can trust that the code
it is linking to will not abuse the privileges derived from the EXE.
The DLL is trusted not to abuse the privilege it has been granted,
and so may safely be loaded into processes running with that capability
level. The rule is enforced by the program loader.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-1B679A3F-1893-4214-B575-2550F5B0753D"><h3 class="section-title">Process
identity</h3><p>Every EXE in the system contains a 32-bit secure
identifier value, referred to as the SID. A SID cannot be changed.
When an EXE is launched, the SID is copied from the EXE into the process.
If the same EXE is launched multiple times, all the processes will
have the same SID.</p><p>You can specify the SID of an application
using the <code class="codeph">TARGET.SID</code> variable in the project file.
More commonly a SID is not explicitly specified. In this case the
value of the SID defaults to the same as the value of the <code class="codeph">TARGET.UID3</code> variable.</p><p>There is a protected range of
SIDs (from 0x00000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF) that is managed by <a href="http://www.symbiansigned.com/" target="_blank">Symbian Signed</a>. EXEs that contain SIDs in the protected range must be signed by
an approved authority (this is enforced by the software installer
at install time). This means that code running on the device can be
assured that protected SIDs were properly assigned from the global
SID-space. So protected SIDs are globally unique, and can be used
to identify individual applications.</p><p>If an application has a
secure identifier in the protected range, the system is able to protect
it from other applications. This means that it can store private data
in its own private directory that is inaccessible to other applications,
that other applications are not able to impersonate it, and that other
application install packages are not able to alter it. Note that processes
with the AllFiles capability can access private directories belonging
to other applications. However, AllFiles is only granted to very trusted
applications.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-26718EF0-864F-49DD-AF4C-D8665F7173E2"><h3 class="section-title">Data
caging</h3><p>Data caging is the term used to describe the practice
of restricting access to certain parts of the file system. Data caging
protects read-only resources from accidental or intentional modification
by unauthorized code, and provides each EXE with its own private data
area.</p><p>Data caging is enforced by the file server on a per-directory
basis. The following top-level directories have some restrictions
placed on them:</p><div class="p"><div class="tablenoborder"><a name="GUID-23BFAF3F-6ACF-48E6-85AE-08EE0374575C"><!-- --></a><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="GUID-23BFAF3F-6ACF-48E6-85AE-08EE0374575C" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">

</table></div></div><p><strong>Data caging and removable media</strong></p><div class="p">Binaries
can be stored on removable cards. If the card is inserted into a reader
attached to a PC, we could directly alter the capabilities inside
the binaries. To prevent this, when binaries are installed to a removable
drive, the installer calculates a hash of the binary, and stores the
hash on the internal drive, under \sys\hash\. Then when the loader
loads any binary from a removable drive, it recalculates the hash
of the binary and checks that it matches the hash retrieved from the
internal \sys\hash\ directory. If it doesn’t match, it fails to load.
So: <ul>
<li><p>Any binaries on removable media that have not been through
the installer will not be run, because the hash will not be found. </p></li>
<li><p>Any binaries on removable media that have been altered post-install
will not be run, because the hash will not match.</p></li>
