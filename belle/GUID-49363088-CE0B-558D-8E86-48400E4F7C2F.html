<div id="GUID-A8950BFC-6458-4E6A-A3FC-A2FC5FC704FD"><h3 class="section-title">Description</h3> <p>Alarm Server provides all alarm-related services to the system.
When an alarm expires, Alarm Server notifies the Alert Server about
the expired alarm to display to the user. </p> <p>The state properties
are the same for single and multiple alarm notification, but the condition
for moving to ‘notifying’ state is different. If multiple alarm notification
is supported, more than one alarm can move to ‘notifying’ state provided
that Alert Server can accept more than one alarm from Alarm Server.
Even if a UI application can accept multiple notifying alarms, it
cannot accept an infinite number of notifying alarms. Therefore, at
Alarm Server startup, Alarm Server will query Alert Server for the
maximum number of notifying alarms allowed. Alarm Server can use that
information to determine if multiple alarm notification is supported,
and if so, how many alarms can be in ‘notifying’ state at the same
time. </p> <p>To support multiple alarm notification, Alarm Server
notifies Alert Server about multiple expired alarms without waiting
for the first alarm to be cleared or snoozed. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-4F324FD2-EB30-5910-BD8E-315B67A4FA44"><img src="GUID-16B42854-F27D-5CB3-BCFE-8F711793EE60_d0e442429_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>              Alarm state diagram for multiple alarm notification
             support            </p></div> <p>In the diagram above, a queued alarm can change to the ‘waiting
to notify’ state if an alarm has expired but the maximum number of
notifying alarms has been reached. The state can also change if Alarm
Server is waiting for a reply from Alert Server. This second scenario
may occur because even though Alert Server can accept multiple alarms,
the Alarm Server needs the previous asynchronous request EASAltOpCodeSetAlarm to be completed before sending the
next one. As the UI application is implemented by licensee, this scenario
may or may not occur depending on how long the UI application takes
to register multiple alarms. </p> <p>If the Alert Server can still
accept more alarms the ‘waiting to notify’ alarm can change to ‘notifying’
state after the asynchronous request EASAltOpCodeSetAlarm is completed. </p> <p>As demonstrated above, a 'notifying' alarm
can change to ‘snoozed’ state if: </p> <ol id="GUID-31855E68-7830-5B92-83DB-7BAFBF660B53">
<li id="GUID-EAFA400D-1FCE-5036-9522-13CB1A2C23E0"><a name="GUID-EAFA400D-1FCE-5036-9522-13CB1A2C23E0"><!-- --></a><p>The user requests
‘snooze’ </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-92CA5327-A999-526A-BB0F-36279B98AFEE"><a name="GUID-92CA5327-A999-526A-BB0F-36279B98AFEE"><!-- --></a><p>Another alarm
has expired and the current alarm has sound playing paused. This scenario
occurs if the paused alarm is the only notifying alarm </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-7224BE4C-AF70-5F05-9BAE-0B95C8FFE483"><a name="GUID-7224BE4C-AF70-5F05-9BAE-0B95C8FFE483"><!-- --></a><p>The sound playing
is paused for the current notifying alarm. If this occurs and there
are multiple notifying alarms, the currently notifying alarm is snoozed
instead of paused. </p> </li>
</ol> <p>For single alarm notification, a notifying alarm has sound
paused when Alarm Server receives a EASAltAlertServerResponsePauseSound event from Alert Server. If another alarm has expired while the
notifying alarm has sound paused, Alarm Server snoozes the paused
alarm automatically and plays the sound of the just expired alarm.
In case of multiple alarm notification, the ‘sound paused’ alarm automatically
snoozes if other alarms notify at the same time. </p> <p>It is a design
decision to make the implementation compatible with the existing implementation.
That way if the maximum number of alarms is set to one, the implementation
is exactly that same as before. </p> <p>In case of multiple alarm
notification, pausing the playing alarm triggers the Alarm Server
to play sound for one of the other notifying alarms. This is because
the sound pause request only applies to the specified alarm. </p> <p>If the user wants to silence the alarm while keeping the alarm in
‘notifying’ state, the user can respond with ‘silent’ (EASAltAlertServerResponseSilence), which will silence the alarm until the next alarm play interval
re-starts (an existing behaviour in single alarm notification). Alternatively,
a global silent command (EASAltAlertServerResponseQuietPeriod) will pause sound for all alarms for a specified time while all
expired alarms will stay in ‘notifying’ state. </p> </div>
