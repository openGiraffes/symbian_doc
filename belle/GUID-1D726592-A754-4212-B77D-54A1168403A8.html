<div id="GUID-01AB667B-BC62-43F5-8727-F5A37F0E7F25"><h3 class="section-title">Background</h3><p>When using Qt and Symbian C++ together, you may need to make use
of a Symbian service with an asynchronous API. The best way to do
this is to wrap the request in an active object and then notify completion
of the request to Qt code using a Qt <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/signalsandslots.html" target="_blank">signal</a>. </p><p>Converting an active object's completion events
into signals and slots is straightforward: </p><ul>
<li><p>Use the PIMPL idiom to create a public Qt-style API. </p></li>
<li><p>Create the active object as the Symbian private implementation
class (or as an object owned by the private class). </p></li>
<li><p>Map functions/slots in the public class to functions that start
the active object. </p></li>
<li><p>Emit signals when the active object completes successfully
using its pointer to the public implementation. Only Qt-style objects
should be emitted with the signal. </p></li>
<li><p>Emit signals if an error occurs. Qt uses module-local errors,
so you should translate global (or local) errors from the underlying
interface into errors defined by the module public API. </p></li>
</ul><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>Sometimes it may be possible to do a zero-copy transfer
from a Symbian object to the Qt Object. For example it is possible
to initialize a <code class="codeph">QString</code> to use a pointer to a buffer
you have received from your asynchronous service. As always with C++,
you need to ensure that the object you transfer has a lifetime that
exceeds all of its users. Given the different approaches used by Qt
and Symbian C++ for memory management, it is usually better to create
a "fully new" Qt style object.</p></div><p>For a general introduction

is an active object) and builds on <a href="GUID-123ED0A9-2F1C-4DDD-9D90-E8DDADF673DB.html">Mixing Qt and Symbian

<div id="GUID-1007D830-62CE-4817-9B61-0E2C623E08D4"><h3 class="section-title">Signalling
from the active object </h3><p>You signal errors and events from
the private object back to the Qt API by emitting an appropriate signal
on the public class. This is possible because the private object is
passed a pointer to the public object on construction. Any objects
that are emitted must be Qt-style objects to hide the private class
implementation. Errors that are emitted must be local to the current
Qt component (typically defined as enums on the public API) and not
global Symbian errors. </p><p>The signal that is emitted can be connected
to any number of slots. This has two implications: </p><ul>
<li><p>Slots that run inside the context of our non-preemptive active
scheduler (<code class="codeph">RunL()</code>) must be kept short. If the total
time spent in all slots is too great, the UI may become unresponsive
(or worse, block). </p></li>
<li><p>Any of the slots connected to the signal can throw, and this
propagates back to the emit. For this reason we use <code class="codeph">QT_TRYCATCH_LEAVING</code> barriers when we emit signals that can propagate into Symbian code.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>RunL() </strong></p><p>Below is a fragment of the <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate::RunL()</code>, which is called when the asynchronous service completes. <code class="codeph">RunL()</code> is called when call connection and disconnection
requests complete. The code checks if the completing request was to
connect or disconnect a phone call and it emits the appropriate signal.
If there is an error, it is converted to a <code class="codeph">Telephony::TelephonyErrors</code> enum value, which is emitted as a parameter with the <code class="codeph">error()</code> signal.</p><pre class="codeblock">// Called when an asynchronous service request completes.
// This is called when requests for connecting and disconnecting calls complete.

{

}</pre><p><strong>SetActive() </strong></p><p>The private functions <code class="codeph">startCall()</code>  and <code class="codeph">endCall()</code> start the active
object. They check the current object state, and if necessary, create
an asynchronous request on a <code class="codeph">CTelephony</code> object to
start or end a phone call. Finally they call <code class="codeph">CActive::SetActive()</code> to set the object active. </p><p>In the Dialpad example <code class="codeph">startCall()</code> emits a signal on error (the object is already
started) or to notify clients that it started successfully. Here we
do not need a barrier around the emit call because although it can
throw, <code class="codeph">startCall()</code> can only be called by the Qt API.
The behavior of <code class="codeph">endCall()</code> is similar. </p><pre class="codeblock">// Public interface slot implementation - start a call using number.

the derived class's <code class="codeph">CActive::DoCancel()</code> implementation
if it is called when the object is active. The <code class="codeph">Cancel()</code> function MUST  be called from the active object destructor to cancel
any outstanding requests - the active scheduler panics because of
a “stray signal” if a destroyed object is still waiting on a signal. </p><p>In the Dialpad example <code class="codeph">DoCancel()</code> cancels an
outstanding request to start or end a phone call. </p><pre class="codeblock">// Cancel an outstanding asynchronous request.
// What to do here depends on what state the call is in.

is not implemented in the Dialpad example, where the <code class="codeph">TelephonyPrivate</code> implementation is a <code class="codeph">CActive</code> object instead.</p></div></div><p>Symbian C++ provides APIs that use callbacks to signal
completion of an asynchronous service. (Internally these are implemented
as active objects; using a callback simplifies the use of the API
for client code.) A good example of this is <a href="GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-778D24B5-A68E-3C91-B66A-69007FBA4791.html#GUID-C6E5F800-0637-419E-8FE5-1EBB40E725AA/GUID-778D24B5-A68E-3C91-B66A-69007FBA4791.html"><code class="apiname">CMdaAudioPlayerUtility</code></a>, which takes an instance of <code class="codeph">MMdaAudioPlayerCallback</code> in its static factory constructor, and calls methods on this to
indicate when initialisation and playing are complete. </p><p>Wrapping
a Symbian C++ callback is even easier than using an active object
directly. Again you can use PIMPL to create a Qt class, with a private
implementation. This private implementation owns an instance of the
Symbian class and implements its callback interface. </p><pre class="codeblock">class MyAudioPlayerPrivate : public QObject, public MMdaAudioPlayerCallback
{
public:
    QMyAudioPlayer (MyAudioPlayer *wrapper = 0);
    ~QMyAudioPlayer ();
 
public:
    //methods, slots intiate play (duplicate API of the public class)
 
public: //From MMdaAudioPlayerCallback
    virtual void MapcInitComplete(TInt aError, const TTimeIntervalMicroSeconds &amp;aDuration;);
    virtual void MapcPlayComplete(TInt aError);
 
private:
    void ErrorConvertToLocal(int err);
 
private: // Data
    CMdaAudioPlayerUtility *iAudioPlayer;  //The audio player object
    MyAudioPlayer *d_ptr; // pointer to Qt public API
};
 
 
MyAudioPlayerPrivate::MyAudioPlayerPrivate (MyAudioPlayer *wrapper) 
: d_ptr(wrapper)
{
    QT_TRAP_THROWING(iAudioPlayer=CMdaAudioPlayerUtility::NewL(this)); 
        //note, throws if can't construct object
}
 
MyAudioPlayerPrivate::~MyAudioPlayerPrivate()
{
    delete iAudioPlayer;
}
</pre><p>We can then emit any needed signals from the callback: </p><pre class="codeblock">MyAudioPlayerPrivate::initialisationComplete()
{
    QT_TRY {
        emit d_ptr-&gt;initialisationComplete();
    }
    QT_CATCH (std::exception&amp;amp;) {}
}
</pre><p>Note that the above code traps exceptions, and does
not deal with them or re-throw them. Generally this is not good practice.
However, here we are constrained by the API - we cannot leave because
its prototype indicates that it may only be used in a leave-safe way.
Similarly we cannot throw, because this leads back into Symbian code.
Absorbing the errors is our only choice. </p><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Caution: </strong>It is important to remember that any callback may be run from
within the context of a <code class="codeph">RunL()</code>. If you have any Qt
code that might throw in a leaving callback, this should be wrapped
in a <code class="codeph">QT_TRYCATCH_LEAVING</code> method.</p></div></div>
