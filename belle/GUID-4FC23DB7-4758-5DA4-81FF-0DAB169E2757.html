<div id="GUID-296FB987-9E61-5925-9246-0468534D16A9"><h3 class="section-title">Handling
SQL schema errors</h3> <p>In order to translate a SQL statement
into bytecode, <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code> needs to know the database
schema. For any given SQL statement there are typically many different
ways of implementing the statement in bytecode. The compiler (or a
particular part of the compiler that is commonly referred to as the <em>optimizer</em>) tries to pick the most efficient implementation based
on what is known about the content of the various tables and what
indexes are available. The bytecode depends so much on the database
schema that the slightest change to the schema can cause totally different
bytecode to be generated for the same SQL statement. </p> <p>When <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code> runs, it uses the database schema as of the last
time the database was accessed when preparing the bytecode. So if
the database schema has been changed by another program, or if the
schema is changed after <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code> completes but before <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> or <code class="codeph">Next()</code> is run, the schema of
the database will not match the schema used to prepare the bytecode. </p> <p>To guard against any problems, the first few instructions of
bytecode in a prepared statement read the current schema cookie for
the database and check to see that it is the same as it was when <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code> was run. If the schema cookie has changed, then <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> and <code class="codeph">Next()</code> terminate with the error KSqlErrSchema. </p> <p>When this occurs, a new prepared
statement should be created by calling <code class="codeph">Prepare()</code> again
with the same SQL and the original prepared statement should be discarded. </p> <p>It is important to recognize that a KSqlErrSchema error can occur on any call to <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> or <code class="codeph">Next()</code>. A common programming error with is to omit the necessary
error handling or to do it incorrectly. The error is, unfortunately,
often overlooked during testing because the usual cause of an KSqlErrSchema error is an external program making a schema
change at just the wrong moment, and external programs are not normally
running during testing. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-0D7324A8-8DAF-57B5-BCA1-C8BDD855773C"><h3 class="section-title"> Designing
tables for more efficient access</h3> <p>Put smaller and frequently
accessed columns at the beginning of tables. SQLite stores a row of
a table by gathering the data for all columns in that row and packing
the data together in column order into as few bytes as possible. <em>Column order</em> means that the data for the first declared column
of the table – the column that appears first in the CREATE TABLE statement
– is packed into the bundle first. The data for the second column
is packed into the bundle second. And so forth. </p> <p>SQLite goes
to some trouble to use as few bytes as possible when storing data.
A text string that is 5 bytes long, for example, is stored using just
5 bytes. The '\00' terminator on the end is omitted. No padding bytes
or overhead are added even if the column specifies a larger string
such as VARCHAR(1000). </p> <p>Small integers (between -127 and +127)
are stored as a single byte. As the magnitude of the integer increases,
additional bytes of storage are added as necessary up to 8 bytes.
Floating point numbers are normally stored as 8-byte IEEE floats,
but if the floating point number can be represented as a smaller integer
without loss of information, it is converted and stored that way to
save space. BLOBs are also stored using the minimum number of bytes
necessary. </p> <p>These efforts to save space both help to keep SQLite
database files small and also improve performance since the smaller
each record is the more information will fit in the same amount of
space and the less disk I/O needs to occur. </p> <p>The downside of
using compressed storage is that data in each column is an unpredictable
size. So within each row, we do not know in advance where one column
ends and the next column begins. To extract the data from the N-th
column of a row, SQLite has to decode the data from the N-1 prior
columns first. Thus, for example, if you have a query that reads just
the fourth column of a table, the bytecode that implements the query
has to read and discard the data from the first, second, and third
columns in order to find where the data for the fourth column begins
in order to read it out. </p> <p>For this reason, it is best to put
smaller and more frequently accessed columns of a table early in the
CREATE TABLE statement and put large CLOBs and BLOBs and infrequently
accessed information toward the end. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-DAF6BE02-7D38-5667-86B2-D12EB34BB6EC"><h3 class="section-title">Storing
Large BLOBs Separately from the Database</h3> <p>SQLite does not
place arbitrary constraints on the size of BLOBs and CLOBs that it
will store. The only real restriction is that the entire BLOB or CLOB
must fit in memory all at once. But just because you can do this does
not mean you should. </p> <p>Although SQLite is able to handle really
big BLOBs, it is not optimized for that case. If performance and storage
efficiency is a concern, you will be better served to store large
BLOBs and CLOBs in separate disk files then store the name of the
file in the database in place of the actual content. </p> <p>When
SQLite encounters a large table row – e.g. because it contains one
or more large BLOBs – it tries to store as much of the row as it can
on a single page of the database. The tail of the row that will not
fit on a single page is spilled into overflow pages. If more than
one overflow page is required, then the overflow pages form a linked
list. </p> <p>To store a 1MiB BLOB in a database with a 1KiB page
size will require the BLOB to be broken into a list of over a thousand
links, each of which gets stored separately. Whenever you want to
read the BLOB out of the database, SQLite has to walk this thousand-member
linked list in order to reassemble the BLOB again. This works and
is reliable, but it is not especially efficient. </p> <p>Another problem
with large BLOBs and CLOBs is that they can be neither read nor written
incrementally. The entire BLOB or CLOB must be read or written all
at once. So, for example, to append 10 bytes to the end of a 10MiB
BLOB, one has to read the entire BLOB, append the 10 bytes, then write
the new BLOB back out again. With a disk file, on the other hand,
you can append 10 bytes quickly and efficiently without having to
access the other 10 million bytes of the original file. </p> <p>If
you absolutely need to store large BLOBs and CLOBs in your database
(perhaps so that changes to these data elements will be atomic and
durable) then at least consider storing the BLOBs and CLOBs in separate
tables that contain only an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and the content of
the BLOB or CLOB. So, instead of writing your schema this way: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TABLE image(
    imageId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    imageTitle TEXT,
    imageWidth INTEGER,
    imageHeight INTEGER,
    imageRefCnt INTEGER,
    imageBlob BLOB
);
</pre> <p>Factor out the large BLOB into a separate table so
that your schema looks more like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TABLE image(
    imageId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    imageTitle TEXT,
    imageWidth INTEGER,
    imageHeight INTEGER,
    imageRefCnt INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE imagedata(
    imageId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    imageBlob BLOB
);
</pre> <p>Keeping all of the small columns in a separate table
increases locality of reference and allows queries that do not use
the large BLOB to run much faster. You can still write single queries
that return both the smaller fields and the BLOB by using a simple
(and very efficient) join on the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-8F18A8B8-706F-5F53-88BC-249F9EB48110"><h3 class="section-title">Using
INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</h3> <p>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is a fast special
case. Every row of every SQLite table has a signed 64-bit integer
RowID. This RowID is the key for the b-tree that holds the table content.
The RowID must be unique over all other rows in the same table. When
you go to find, insert, or remove a row from a table in SQLite, the
row is first located by search for its RowID. Searching by RowID is
very fast. Everything in SQLite tables centres around RowIDs. </p> <p>In the CREATE TABLE statement that defines a table, if you declare
a column to be of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then that column becomes
an alias for the RowID. It is generally a good idea to create such
a column whenever it is practical. </p> <p>Looking up information
by RowID or INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is usually about twice as fast as
any other search method in SQLite. So for example, if we have an indexed
table like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TABLE demo1(
    id1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    id2 INTEGER UNIQUE,
    content BLOB
);
</pre> <p>Then queries against the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, e.g.
of the form: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT content FROM demo1 WHERE id1=?;
</pre> <p>will be about twice as fast as queries like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT content FROM demo1 WHERE id2=?;
</pre> <p>Note that the following two queries are identical
in SQLite – not just equivalent but identical. They generate exactly
the same bytecode: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT content FROM demo1 WHERE id1=?;
SELECT content FROM demo1 WHERE RowID=?;
</pre> <p>But for stylistic and portability reasons, the first
form of the query is preferred. </p> <p>Also observe that in order
for the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY to truly be an alias for the RowID, the
declared type must be exactly “INTEGER PRIMARY KEY”. </p> <p>Variations
such as “INT PRIMARY KEY” or “UNSIGNED INTEGER PRIMARY KEY” or “SHORTINT
PRIMARY KEY” become independent columns instead of aliases for the
RowID. </p> <p>So be careful to always spell INTEGER PRIMARY KEY correctly
in your CREATE TABLE statements. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-BD8FE233-2AA5-5DF7-9A84-EEC5836669E8"><h3 class="section-title"> Efficient
Primary Key and Row ID values</h3> <p>Use small positive integers
for INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or RowID. As explained in the section <a href="#GUID-8F18A8B8-706F-5F53-88BC-249F9EB48110">Using INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</a>, every table row has a key which
is a signed 64-bit integer: the RowID or INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. This
same RowID also occurs in every index entry and is used to refer the
index entry back to the original table row. </p> <p>When writing the
RowID to disk, SQLite encodes the 64-bit integer value using a Huffman
code over a fixed probability distribution. The resulting encoding
requires between 1 and 9 bytes of storage space, depending on the
magnitude of the integer. Small, non-negative integers require less
space than larger or negative integers. Table 3.1 shows the storage
requirements: </p> <div class="tablenoborder"><a name="GUID-A50643C5-5D28-56C1-B1D9-6BFF1E9551B5"><!-- --></a><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" id="GUID-A50643C5-5D28-56C1-B1D9-6BFF1E9551B5" frame="border" border="1" rules="all">

</table></div> <p> <strong>Table 3.1:</strong> Storage requirements for RowIDs of
different magnitudes </p> <p>This chart makes it clear that the best
way to keep reduce the number of bytes of disk space devoted to storing
RowIDs is to keep RowIDs small non-negative integers. The database
will continue to work fine with large or negative RowIDs, but the
database files will take up more space. </p> <p>SQLite normally works
by assigning RowIDs automatically. An automatically generated RowID
will normally be the smallest positive integer that is not already
used as a RowID in the same table. The first RowID assigned will be
1, the second 2, and so forth. So the automatic RowID assignment algorithm
begins by using 1-byte RowIDs, then moves to 2-byte RowIDs as the
number of rows increased, then 3-byte RowIDs, and so forth. In other
words, the automatic RowID assignment algorithm does a good job of
selecting RowIDs that minimize storage requirements. </p> <p>If a
table contains an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column, that column becomes
an alias for the RowID. If you then specify a particular RowID when
doing an INSERT, the RowID you specify overrides the default choice
made by SQLite itself. For example, if your table is this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TABLE demo311(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    content VARCHAR(100)
);
</pre> <p>Then if you insert like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
INSERT INTO demo311(id,content) VALUES(-17,'Hello');
</pre> <p>The value -17 is used as the RowID which requires
9 bytes of space in the disk file because it is negative. If instead
of specifying the id value you had just left it blank: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
INSERT INTO demo311(content) VALUES('Hello');
</pre> <p>Or if you had specified a NULL as the INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY value: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
INSERT INTO demo311(id,content) VALUES(NULL,'Hello');
</pre> <p>Then in either case, SQLite would have automatically
selected a RowID value that was the smallest positive integer not
already in use, thus minimizing the amount of disk space required. </p> <p>Therefore unless you have specific requirements to the contrary,
it generally works best to let SQLite pick its own RowID and INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY values. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-40CDE965-B261-5873-9F8B-7812EEC14AD7"><h3 class="section-title">Keep
Schemas Small and Constant</h3> <p>SQLite stores the original text
of all CREATE statements in a system table of the database. When a
database session is opened or when the database schema is changed,
SQLite has to read and parse all of these CREATE statements in order
to reconstruct its internal symbol tables. </p> <p>The parser and
symbol table builder inside SQLite are very fast, but they still take
time which is proportional to the size of the schema. To minimize
the computational overhead associated with parsing the schema: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-36BDF092-298D-564D-9744-9C83836A2FB2"><a name="GUID-36BDF092-298D-564D-9744-9C83836A2FB2"><!-- --></a><p>Keep the number
and size of CREATE statements in the schema to a minimum. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-DF3A6363-7C24-5727-AD27-58367EFFE1A4"><a name="GUID-DF3A6363-7C24-5727-AD27-58367EFFE1A4"><!-- --></a><p>Avoid unnecessary
calls to RSqlDatabase::Open(). Reuse the same database
session where possible. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-D1A62767-9CF7-5FBE-8F51-98EB154559C1"><a name="GUID-D1A62767-9CF7-5FBE-8F51-98EB154559C1"><!-- --></a><p>Avoid changing
the database schema while other threads or processes might be using
the database. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Whenever the schema is reparsed, all statements that were
prepared using the old schema are invalidated. A call <code class="codeph">Next()</code> or <code class="codeph">Exec()</code> on a RSqlStatement object that was prepared prior to the schema reparse will return KSqlErrSchema to let you know that the cause of the error
was a schema change. Thus any prepared statements that were cached
will have to be discarded and re-prepared following a schema change.
Refilling the prepared statement cache can be as computationally expensive
as parsing the schema in the first place. </p> <p>Prepared statements
can be invalidated for reasons other than schema changes including
executing <code class="codeph">Attach()</code> or <code class="codeph">Detach()</code>.
Avoid this if you have a large cache of prepared statements. The best
strategy is to attach all associated databases as soon as a new database
session is opened and before any statements are prepared. </p> </div>
