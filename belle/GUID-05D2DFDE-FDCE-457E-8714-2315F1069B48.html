<div id="GUID-38975047-2E7C-4D26-A21F-D91D414F3028"><h3 class="section-title">Symbian
exceptions and errors</h3><p>Symbian C++ uses its own exception
mechanism consisting of TRAPs (somewhat equivalent to <em>try</em>),
Leaves (a bit like <em>throw</em>), and the <a href="GUID-1FFE4ED5-7B2E-58A0-9D08-A096F53F37AB.html">Cleanup Stack</a> (which allows locally scoped heap-allocated objects to be safely
deleted in the event of an exception). </p><p>Potentially leaving
code is run inside a <a href="GUID-3AD20E0C-F364-533F-9FBC-227478CA9982.html">TRAP</a> macro.
In the event of a Leave, the call stack is unwound up to the TRAP,
automatic variables are deallocated and the Cleanup Stack deletes
or otherwise cleans up any objects on the current TRAP level. The
TRAP macro returns the leave error code (a single integer) and execution
continues immediately afterwards (there is no separate "catch"). Much
like catch blocks, the code following a TRAP is expected to handle
leave codes that it understands, and Leave again with any that it
does not understand. </p><pre class="codeblock">TInt result;
TRAP(result, MayLeaveL());
 
if (KErrNone!=result) {
// Deal with errors that can be handled at this level
// Leave again with any errors you choose not to handle
}</pre><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>TRAPs are relatively heavy weight in terms of
executable size and RAM consumption. While these can be nested and
used at any level, it is usually better to trap at a high level, grouping
a number of Leaving functions.</p></div>Symbian uses a naming convention
for functions and <a href="GUID-2458916B-55B2-5E08-A825-4EBDB3503E67.html">class types</a> to help developers understand how to safely allocate
objects to prevent memory leaks: </div><ul>
<li><p>Functions that might <code class="codeph">Leave</code> are by convention
named with a trailing <code class="codeph">L</code> (or <code class="codeph">LC</code> to
indicate that the object remains on the Cleanup Stack when the method
returns). </p></li>
<li><p>Classes that should be allocated on the heap usually first
derive from <code class="codeph">CBase</code> and are named with the <code class="codeph">C</code> prefix. </p><ul>
<li><p><code class="codeph">CBase</code> provides zero member initialization
on construction, an overload of new that Leaves (<code class="codeph">new (ELeave)</code>) in the event of allocation failure, and a virtual destructor that
the Cleanup Stack can use to delete  the object in the event of a
Leave. (The cleanup stack also provides methods to delete other heap-based
objects that are not derived from <code class="codeph">CBase</code>, such as
arrays and interface classes.) </p></li>
<li><p>C classes are constructed using the leave-safe <a href="GUID-48AD5B98-DBA8-4601-A158-12559985BCEB.html">two-phase construction</a> idiom. </p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The T prefix is used for stack-allocated classes that do not
own pointers to heap resources and do not have a destructor. </p></li>
<li><p>The R prefix is used for stack classes that own resources elsewhere
– and therefore require explicit support for cleanup. </p></li>
</ul><p>In Symbian's original implementation, the destructors of automatic
variables were not called in the event of a Leave. As a result smart
pointers could not be used for local object cleanup. The naming conventions
allow you to work out whether objects require explicit cleanup support
via the cleanup stack (R, C classes) or not (T classes).</p><p><a href="GUID-26D7BC6E-509C-51C5-9B86-437F3AEEB2EA.html">Exception Handling</a> in the Symbian guide provides a more detailed discussion of how
the exception mechanism works and how to write leave-safe code. Leave-safe
object construction is discussed in the introduction to <a href="GUID-48AD5B98-DBA8-4601-A158-12559985BCEB.html">Two-phase construction</a> and in more detail in <a href="GUID-5EBA3C03-2E4E-5DBA-BB5B-0D40DAB3C39B.html">Two Phase Construction</a> in the Symbian Guide. </p><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>At the time Symbian C++ was created,
standard C++ try-catch-throw exception handling was considered too
memory-expensive for an embedded operating system. In addition, there
was limited support in the compilers in use at that time.  Standard
C++ exception support was added in Symbian OS v9.</p></div></div><p>Symbian's
exception handling mechanism is now implemented in terms of try, catch
and throw. You can use try, catch and throw  in standard C++ code,
and even mix them with Symbian C++ (with care).</p><p>Symbian functions
use either Leaves or error codes to signal an exception condition.
Returning an error is usually preferred to Leaving when the error
condition is "expected" (for example, attempting to read past the
end of a file). However, there are no firm rules (other than class
construction always leaves with <code class="codeph">KErrNoMemory</code> if there
is no memory to allocate the object), and you will see errors and
Leaves used in an ad-hoc manner within the Symbian C++ APIs. It is
considered bad programming practice to have a function that leaves <em>and</em> returns an error, or to convert a leave to an error (using
a TRAP without good reason). </p><p>There is a set of global error
codes (negative integer values), defined in <code>e32err.h</code>. Other error codes are defined within individual components
– there are a number of lists, including the one on <a href="http://www.newlc.com/fr/Symbian-OS-Error-Codes.html" target="_blank">www.newlc.com</a>. </p><p>Symbian defines a second
class of exception called a <a href="GUID-B2DDCCB6-4350-4A67-9015-DE7094C0F590.html">panic</a>. A Panic
is used to signal programmatic errors and results in immediate termination
of the application – this is an appropriate response to misuse of
an API. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-4C1CC3A2-AF9D-4635-940B-CB5F87C50FCA"><h3 class="section-title">Qt
exceptions and error codes</h3><p>Qt supports the standard C++
exception handling mechanism where it is available on the underlying
platform and compiler. </p><p>Although Qt has supported the mechanism
for third-party code since the beginning, historically Qt framework
code has not used the mechanism (for reasons of cross-platform compatibility).
Instead Qt code uses locally defined error codes to notify client
code of error conditions. When there is a failure to allocate memory,
framework code simply returns a null pointer and fails on first pointer
dereference (except for some larger objects, where special measures
are taken). </p><p>Qt 4.6 supports basic <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/exceptionsafety.html" target="_blank">exception safety</a> (component invariants are preserved and no
resources are leaked) for Qt's container classes as well as for the <code class="codeph">QFile</code> class: </p><ul>
<li><p>The <code class="codeph">QScopedPointer</code> smart-pointer has been
added to allow locally scoped objects to be cleaned up in the event
of an exception (during use or on construction). </p></li>
<li><p>Objects now throw <code class="codeph">std::bad_alloc</code> if memory
cannot be allocated (using <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#q_check_ptrx" target="_blank">q_check_ptr()</a> to check the returned pointer). </p></li>
<li><p>try/catch blocks have been added where appropriate.</p></li>
</ul><p>Qt does not (at the time of writing) define its own exception
class hierarchy, and the framework code only throws <code class="codeph">std::bad_alloc</code>. Qt itself still uses error codes rather than exceptions to propagate
errors other than allocation failure. Developers should assume that
almost any Qt class can <code class="codeph">throw</code>, and that where it
interacts with third-party code, it can throw virtually anything.
(An exception is <code class="codeph">QScopedPointer</code>'s constructor, which
means that it can safely be used for cleaning up locally scoped objects.)
When Qt catches exceptions, it always rethrows them if they are not
handled. </p><p>You should use the macros <code class="codeph">QT_TRY</code>, <code class="codeph">QT_CATCH</code>, <code class="codeph">QT_THROW</code>, and <code class="codeph">QT_RETHROW</code> (defined in <code>qglobal.h</code>) in preference to calling
try, catch and throw  directly. This ensures that exception handling
code is only compiled on platforms that support exceptions. Note that
if you write your application to be exception safe, it will work whether
exceptions are enabled or not. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-10D7581D-2E10-4674-9297-AABD04C46AAA"><h3 class="section-title">Mixing
Symbian C++ and Qt exception handling</h3><p>Qt uses standard C++
exceptions while Symbian C++ uses Leaves. Although Leaves are implemented
in terms of exceptions, care needs to be taken to interleave the two
idioms. </p><p><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/symbianexceptionsafety.html" target="_blank">Symbian exception safety</a> succinctly explains
the issues, and describes the barrier functions that you can use to
convert between the idioms. </p><p>The barrier functions allow you
to catch standard exceptions and convert them to Symbian errors or
leaves for propagation into Symbian code, and similarly to convert
Symbian C++ leaves or errors into standard exceptions. The methods
are listed here for convenience: <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#qt_symbian_throwIfError" target="_blank">qt_symbian_throwIfError()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#q_check_ptrx" target="_blank">q_check_ptr()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#QT_TRAP_THROWING" target="_blank">QT_TRAP_THROWING()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#qt_symbian_exception2Error" target="_blank">qt_symbian_exception2Error()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#qt_symbian_exception2LeaveL" target="_blank">qt_symbian_exception2LeaveL()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#QT_TRYCATCH_ERROR" target="_blank">QT_TRYCATCH_ERROR()</a>, <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/doc/qtglobal.html#QT_TRYCATCH_LEAVING" target="_blank">QT_TRYCATCH_LEAVING()</a>. </p><p>The barrier
methods can only catch and convert <em>standard exceptions</em> – application-specific
exceptions propagate through, and cause the application to terminate
if they reach a TRAP. This is expected behavior – by convention code
should catch and handle only those exceptions that it understands
– all other exceptions must be re-thrown. </p><div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>It is tempting
to catch all exceptions with catch (...) or QT_CATCH (...)  to prevent
them propagating to a TRAP and terminating the application. However,
if you do this the error condition still exists – all you have done
is remove any opportunity for the application to handle the error
appropriately – the code may still leak memory or fail in an unpredictable
and hard-to-debug manner.</p></div></div><p>There are a few cases that
are worth more detailed consideration: where a function must not fail,
and where it can fail but must not throw or leave. In both cases "must
not fail" should be treated as "must not fail with a leave or standard
exception" – other exceptions must be allowed to propagate. </p><div class="p">Destructors are a case where a function must not fail (throw exceptions
or Leave). When implementing a destructor: <ul>
<li><p>Try to only use functions that will not fail </p></li>
<li><p>If you must call a function that can Leave, stop it from propagating
using a TRAP macro. </p></li>
<li><p>If you must call a function that can throw, stop standard exceptions
with a <code class="codeph">QT_CATCH</code> (<code class="codeph">const std::exception&amp;</code>). Other exceptions must be allowed to propagate – do not <code class="codeph">QT_CATCH (...)</code> without rethrowing the exception. </p></li>
<li><p>A logical consequence of this is that a Qt slot connected to
the <code class="codeph">QObject::destroyed()</code> signal must be implemented
as if it were destructor code, following all the rules above (it is
emitted in the <code class="codeph">QObject</code> destructor). </p></li>
</ul></div><div class="p">Some functions can fail, but must not throw or leave.
For example Symbian C++ callback methods that do not have the L suffix
cannot leave because the calling code may not have been written to
be leave-safe. Nor can it throw, because there may be a TRAP at a
higher level: <ul>
<li><p>If the function can return an error code, you can use the Qt
barrier functions to convert leaves or standard exceptions to errors. </p></li>
<li><p>If the function prototype does not allow errors to be returned,
you can absorb errors you understand but must throw others. </p></li>
<li><p>In both cases, non-standard exceptions must be allowed to propagate. </p></li>
</ul></div></div>
