<div id="GUID-FDD22568-34C7-4331-8DC9-C40AC5753750"><h3 class="section-title">Introduction </h3> <p>Shared library DLLs are a common
paradigm on most operating systems; re-usable functionality is stored
in a shared library that executable code can link against at build
time and load at runtime. As the functionality in the DLL is shared
by several clients the overall code size, memory usage and maintenance
are reduced. </p> <p>Shared library DLLs are created and used
in much the same way on the Symbian platform as on other platforms.
However there are a number of platform specific issues that developers
need to be aware of: </p><ul>
<li><p>Symbian uses link by ordinal exclusively: Shared library DLLs
provide a fixed API with a number of entry points. On some platforms
entry points can be referenced either by name or by ordinal number
- on Symbian you can only use the ordinal number (the names are stripped
out of the DLL in order to reduce code size). In practice this means
that we will need to create a .def file to ensure that the ordinals
are kept in the same order between releases and thereby maintain binary
compatibility. </p></li>
<li><p>DLLs may need Platform security capabilities. </p></li>
<li><p>DLLs need a unique identifier (UID) </p></li>
<li><p>DLLs that have writeable static data are not fully supported
by the free GCCE 3.4.3 compiler. For more information see <a href="GUID-1ED4913E-DEB4-40EE-8DD9-4F8B8E97AEFC.html">Symbian frameworks</a> .</p></li>
</ul><p>This article walks you through the steps for creating, using
and packaging a shared DLL. At the end of the article there is an
 overview of the code example.</p><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Tip: </strong>While shared
library DLLs are recommended when library code is going to be shared
by many clients, there are other options that may be more suitable
for application developers.</p></div></div>
