platform for Symbian-based devices. The platform is used by device
manufactures to build devices, and by third-party developers to create
after-market applications for those Symbian devices.</p>
<div id="GUID-1212158F-A8CF-41FE-A6B9-4461D90EA2A5"><h3 class="section-title">Overview</h3><p>The Symbian platform includes a customizable user interface, a
rich set of applications, common user interface components (AVKON
and Qt Quick ) and development tools for implementing new applications.
It also includes tools and documentation that enables device creators
and application developers to create feature-rich devices and applications.</p><p>The Symbian platform architecture is divided into different layers:</p><ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Applications Layer</strong> consists of application-specific
UI and engine components. It uses the services provided by Middleware
and OS layers. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Middleware Layer</strong> consists of domains which provide
services to the application layer; for example, Multimedia, Networking
and Location services.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Operating System (OS) Layer</strong> provides all higher-level
OS services across a full range of technology domains such as communications,
networking, graphics, multimedia and so on. It also includes low-level
OS services such as frameworks, libraries and utilities, which turn
the abstracted hardware and OS mechanisms into a programmable interface. </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Adaptation layer</strong> integrates the generic platform
software with the phone’s cellular platform. It is implemented by
the device creators though reference implementations are provided
with the platform.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Cellular Platform</strong> is the device-specific hardware
and cellular software that performs the services required by the Symbian
platform.</p></li>

new user experience with the renewed user interface, better navigation
controls, improved status bar, and much more. For a brief introduction
to this release and the devices running on it, refer to <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/symbian-belle" target="_blank">Symbian belle</a>.</p><p>Symbian Belle also needs
a change in the way developers have been looking at the Symbian UI,
as the UI is not the same anymore. The UI changes in
Symbian Belle are detailed in the <a href="GUID-E05B471F-6B74-4A33-91A8-6F30F1A2951E.html">UI style guide</a> to help the developers understand and adapt to them in their applications.</p></div>
