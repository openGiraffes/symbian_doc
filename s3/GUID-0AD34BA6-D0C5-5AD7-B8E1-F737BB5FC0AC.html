window contents. Whenever possible, the Window Server performs server-initiated
redraws by repeating the sequence of stored commands, rather than
by sending redraw requests to the client. This minimises the number

of the background to redraw stores. </p>
<p> <strong>Variant</strong>: Both (ScreenPlay and non-ScreenPlay). <strong>Target
audience</strong>: Device creators. </p>
<p>The classes involved with redraw stores are as follows: </p>
<div class="figure" id="GUID-85C23EC3-BADE-5DE1-872D-0D8399209874"><img src="GUID-40437D9A-7503-5087-851A-D1269F0AF9A9_d0e245039_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>           Redraw stores class diagram          </p></div>
<p> <code class="codeph">CWsRedrawMsgWindow</code> is the class representing
a redraw store. Draw commands are stored in a number of segments,
stored in the nested class <code class="codeph">CRedrawSegment</code>. </p>
<p>Redraw drawing takes place as follows: </p>
<ol id="GUID-2C26C7D9-1C38-55E1-BF14-A36A9F9F05F3">
<li id="GUID-2FCE8CBF-6BF3-5033-8BB7-935D0B276F7C"><a name="GUID-2FCE8CBF-6BF3-5033-8BB7-935D0B276F7C"><!-- --></a><p>A call to <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-683603DD-F3D3-3193-BEB3-8236C7DE7F79.html#GUID-28202F81-52FE-30F5-8B8C-ABED0915822E"><code class="apiname">RWindow::Invalidate()</code></a> causes either the whole window, or
a rectangle within it, to be marked as invalid. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-EB4CAD7F-1B3C-5D2A-85FD-31D0C7F9503D"><a name="GUID-EB4CAD7F-1B3C-5D2A-85FD-31D0C7F9503D"><!-- --></a><p>Next, a call
to <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-683603DD-F3D3-3193-BEB3-8236C7DE7F79.html#GUID-9337538E-7A53-3153-A330-968B5E4F2FF2"><code class="apiname">RWindow::BeginRedraw()</code></a> is made, either for the
whole window or for a rectangle within it. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-88AF657A-8C5E-5CE8-BEF9-F8C1E34F6174"><a name="GUID-88AF657A-8C5E-5CE8-BEF9-F8C1E34F6174"><!-- --></a><p>Draw operations
take place. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-58BC4A48-5035-582D-BE17-C15A885F4B5F"><a name="GUID-58BC4A48-5035-582D-BE17-C15A885F4B5F"><!-- --></a><p>Finally there
is a call to <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-683603DD-F3D3-3193-BEB3-8236C7DE7F79.html#GUID-3DE16607-AD3B-3946-BEB3-88512EAAB9CE"><code class="apiname">RWindow::EndRedraw()</code></a>. </p> </li>
</ol>
<p>In this sequence, the draw operations within the <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw()</code> and <code class="codeph">EndRedraw()</code> brackets are interpreted as <em>replacing</em> whatever drawing was previously present in the affected
rectangle. </p>
<p>It is important to bracket all drawing within <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw(TRect)</code> and <code class="codeph">EndRedraw(TRect)</code> calls. In ScreenPlay, the
Window Server ignores all drawing not within <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw()</code> and <code class="codeph">EndRedraw()</code> brackets and triggers a full-window
redraw. In debug builds, there is an option to panic clients violating
this convention. </p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="GUID-8DB1C618-597C-560C-95A2-C0AB2CEBB027.html">Redraw Drawing</a>. </p>
<div id="GUID-27FE041D-3DE3-4290-AF6D-38DDB8970008"><h3 class="section-title">Redraw
segments and non-redraw handling</h3> <p>When the Window Server
receives a batch of redraw drawing, everything between a BeginRedraw/EndRedraw
bracket is stored in a single <strong>redraw segment</strong>. The segment is
marked as <code class="codeph">ESegmentTypePendingRedraw</code> while it is being
received, and <code class="codeph">ESegmentTypeRedraw</code> once it is complete. </p> <p>Redraw segments have a region to which they apply. For <code class="codeph">ESegmentTypeRedraw</code>, the region is initially set to be the
rectangle passed into the <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw()</code> call. When
a new<code class="codeph">ESegmentTypeRedraw</code> is created, its region is
subtracted from the regions of all existing segments. This reflects
the fact that redraw drawing <em>replaces</em> existing drawing. If,
as a consequence of new redraw drawing, the region of an existing
segment becomes empty, that segment is discarded. Its drawing has
been replaced everywhere, so it is no longer needed. </p> <p>What
happens to drawing that is received between an <code class="codeph">EndRedraw</code> and the next <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw</code> —and which is therefore <strong>non-redraw drawing</strong> —depends on which variant is in use: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-0B29AC2F-AD48-5EAB-B3BE-B8FC296B092A"><a name="GUID-0B29AC2F-AD48-5EAB-B3BE-B8FC296B092A"><!-- --></a><p>In ScreenPlay,
non-redraw drawing is not stored in a segment but instead triggers
the Window Server to invalidate the entire window. This means that
the client application must then perform a full window redraw. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-B592A6D0-68B7-5A16-B179-9F78C5FCDBB3"><a name="GUID-B592A6D0-68B7-5A16-B179-9F78C5FCDBB3"><!-- --></a><p>In the non-ScreenPlay
variant, non-redraw drawing is stored in a segment marked as <code class="codeph">ESegmentTypeNonRedraw</code>. For these segments the region is
initially set to be the whole window and does not affect the regions
of existing segments, because non-redraw drawing is drawn over existing
drawing. </p> </li>
</ul> </div>
<div id="GUID-DB24B91E-6628-4B6E-AE9A-ACAB30AA02C3"><h3 class="section-title"> Redraw
store playback</h3> <p>When playback is required, the redraw store
goes through the redraw segments and replays them if the region for
the segment intersects the region that is to be redrawn. It follows
from the way that they are managed that the regions of redraw segments
are mutually disjoint. This means that in ScreenPlay they can be replayed
in any order. This is also true in the non-ScreenPlay when there are
only redraw segments present. </p> <p>In the non-ScreenPlay variant,
any non-redraw segments are replayed in earliest-first order, because
they draw on top of earlier drawing. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-74EC09C2-BB39-42B2-B765-191A7E17A4D6"><h3 class="section-title"> Aging
of non-redraw segments</h3> <p> <strong>Variant</strong>: Non-ScreenPlay
only. </p> <p>Non-redraw segments can cause inefficient operation
of redraw stores. For this reason, in the non-ScreenPlay variant where
non-redraw segments are still used, the Window Server "ages" them.
That is, non-redraw segments are considered to have a finite lifetime,
after which they are discarded. When a non-redraw segment is discarded,
the Window Server makes a redraw request to the client asking it to
provide new draw operations for the invalid region. </p> <p>The lifetime
for non-redraw segments is set in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html">WSINI.INI file</a> using the parameter <code class="codeph">NONREDRAWAGELIMIT</code>, followed
by a duration in microseconds. If this line is not present in the <code class="codeph">WSINI.INI</code>, a default of one second is used. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-8CE71B67-21F3-4D16-9A1A-70A70A24EFD3"><h3 class="section-title">Atomic
Redraws</h3> <p> <strong>Variant</strong>: Both (ScreenPlay and non-ScreenPlay). </p> <p>Another <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html">WSINI.INI file</a> setting that affects redraw storing is <code class="codeph">ATOMICREDRAWS</code>. If this parameter is present, new draw operations
received after a <code class="codeph">BeginRedraw()</code> are not considered
valid until the corresponding <code class="codeph">EndRedraw()</code> is received.
In particular, a new segment does not replace existing segments until
it is complete. This has the consequence that if redraw store playback
is required before the <code class="codeph">EndRedraw()</code> for a new segment
is received, draw operations from old segments for that region are
used instead. Thus drawing within <code class="codeph">Begin/EndRedraw</code> brackets can be considered as an atomic operation. This eliminates
one potential source of flicker. </p> </div>
