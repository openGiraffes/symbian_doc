This page provides a brief summary of these idioms. </p> <div><h3 class="section-title">Encapsulation</h3> <p>Encapsulation is the art of exposing the aspects of a class that a user can see, but hiding the parts that should not be seen. C++ provides the <code class="codeph">public</code> and <code class="codeph">private</code> qualifiers to express this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">class TS
    {
public:
    S(T1 aArg1, T2 aArg2);
    void Use(T3 aArg1,    T4 aArg2);
    ~S();
private:
    TInt iInt;
    TText8 iText;
    TReal iReal;
    };</pre> <p>Often, functions are public, while data is private. This allows a choice of representations for a class. In practical OO programming, classes often have many private functions. For classes whose representation is a fairly basic property and whose functions would provide direct read/write access to member variables, it is quite acceptable to make data public. </p> </div> <div><h3 class="section-title">Inheritance</h3> <p>Inheritance is used to express an is-a relationship: for instance, “a button is-a bordered control”. This allows taxonomies of objects to be built up. In C++, inheritance is represented by derivation. </p> <pre class="codeblock">class CEikButtonBase : public CEikBorderedControl
    {
    // etc
    };</pre> <p>Encapsulation is enhanced by the <code class="codeph">protected</code> qualifier, which means effectively <code class="codeph">private</code> for non-derived classes, but <code class="codeph">public</code> for derived classes. </p> <p>Inheritance is often over-used by designers of object-oriented systems. Inheritance should not be used unless it is natural: for instance, no-one would dispute that a button is a bordered control. But in Smalltalk, a process is an ordered collection. Of what?! In cases like this, it is better for a class to <em>use</em> another class, rather than <em>derive</em> from it. </p> </div> <div><h3 class="section-title">Polymorphism</h3> <p>Polymorphism builds on inheritance to allow an <em>abstract</em> base class to be defined, from which <em>concrete</em> derived classes may inherit. But, these concrete objects may be used without knowing anything about them, other than that they are derived from the abstract base class. </p> <pre class="codeblock">Foo(CCoeControl* aControl)
    {
    aControl-&gt;Draw();
    }</pre> <p>In the code above, for instance, the function knows that a control has a <code class="codeph">Draw()</code> function, but it knows nothing about the type of control or how it is drawn. </p> </div> <div><h3 class="section-title">Relationships</h3> <p>In object oriented systems, the relationships between objects matter very much. Some examples from the Symbian platform include: </p> <ul><li id="GUID-68CCE95A-17AE-5809-B983-B8DE739BDD81"><a name="GUID-68CCE95A-17AE-5809-B983-B8DE739BDD81"><!-- --></a><p>the control environment (<code class="codeph">CCoeEnv</code>) has-a window server session (<code class="codeph">RWsSession</code>). The lifetime of the window server session is identical to that of the control environment. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-2EB9F004-D6BF-56C9-99F4-652230CE2393"><a name="GUID-2EB9F004-D6BF-56C9-99F4-652230CE2393"><!-- --></a><p>the app UI (<code class="codeph">CEikAppUi</code>) uses-a document (<code class="codeph">CEikDocument</code>). The document has independent existence: the app UI may come into being for a while, and then be destroyed, but throughout the app UI’s lifetime, it uses the document. </p> </li> </ul> <p>In these relationships, cardinality is important. An app UI uses only one document, and a control environment has only one window server session. But a dialog (<code class="codeph">CEikDialog</code>) has any number of lines. </p> </div> </div></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="metadata">Last updated November 17th, 2010</p><hr /><div class="copy">© Nokia 2011.</div></div></body>
