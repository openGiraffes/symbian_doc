Quick Start</h1><div><p>Location Based Services (LBS) provides location information for
installed applications and for remote services via a network. Location information
can be used for location stamping artefacts such as photographs and memos,
finding nearby services and facilities, navigation, and the ability for remote
parties to discover the user's whereabouts. </p>
<p>Location-based services (LBS) use coordinates from the World Geodetic System
(WGS 84), which is also used as a reference system by the Global Positioning
System (GPS). </p>
<p>The coordinates are based on values for latitude, longitude, and altitude
(elevation above sea level). </p>
<p>The North Pole is 90 degrees North (+90 degrees) and the South Pole is
90 degrees South (-90 degrees). The Equator is defined as 0 degrees; locations
above it have positive latitudes (0 to +90 degrees); those below (0 to -90
degrees) negative ones.</p>
<p>There are two definitions of North Pole; Magnetic North Pole and True (Geographical)
North Pole. Any application with a compass must check how the API defines
North Pole.</p>
<p>The Magnetic North Pole is the point to which compasses point. The True
North Pole defines latitude as +90 degrees. </p>
<p>Meridians are constant longitudinal (north-south) values. The Prime (Greenwich)
Meridian’s value is 0 degrees. WGS84, which LBS use, defines its zero meridian
some 100 meters east of the Prime one. Locations east of the Prime Meridian
have positive longitudinal values (0 to +180 degrees), those west (0 to -180
degrees) have negative ones. </p>
<p>As seen in the figure below, latitude lines are smaller near the poles.
At the equator, one degree of longitude is roughly 111.3 km, whereas at 60
degrees of latitude one degree of longitude is only 55.8 km, which is more
difficult to see.</p>

main technologies enabled on the Symbian platform by the LBS subsystem are
as follows: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-62F84865-11D4-50BA-A139-7EEA7232BC8F"><a name="GUID-62F84865-11D4-50BA-A139-7EEA7232BC8F"><!-- --></a><p>Global Positioning System
(GPS) </p> <p>The GPS system provides accurate, worldwide positioning. The
main disadvantage of GPS is the long time required to obtain a position fix
when the GPS hardware is first powered. LBS supports Assisted GPS (A-GPS)
to reduce the time required to get a position fix. </p> </li>

based positioning is typically less accurate than GPS, but often provides
a faster fix of adequate accuracy for some applications. </p> </li>
