<p>The superior mobility and connectivity of mobile devices constitutes
their greatest threat, and allows intruders to try different attack
methods against the device. The figure below illustrates the most
common methods of attack against mobile devices.</p>
<div class="figure" id="GUID-2839B915-A025-4404-96A8-B9354F9E5A9F"><img src="GUID-A9E610B7-505C-41C4-9079-BC83C094982E_d0e11837_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>Mobile device and common attack methods</p></div>
<p>Due to the nature of mobile devices, including the potential
vulnerabilities mentioned above, you should consider the following
points when designing your application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a mobile device is lost or stolen, confidential
information (for example, calendar and contacts) can be read even
by those with little expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can access confidential information and files
at any time, including reverse engineering of software and algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data can be transferred from and to the mobile device
through different methods, even accidentally. </p></li>
<li><p>Users may detach removable media or the battery at
any time, which can cause data loss or corruption.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you handle confidential information in your application,
remember that with sufficient motivation and resources there are always
ways to extract information from a mobile device. As the level of
software security improves and attacks become less practical, interest
in hardware attacks may in turn increase.</p>
<p>In the continuously evolving digital world, every application
should have a certain level of robustness against a changing and hostile
environment. Applications should be prepared for data corruption and
alteration, network and storage blackouts, plug-ins and components
that misbehave, malicious attackers, and, perhaps most importantly,
user errors.</p>
