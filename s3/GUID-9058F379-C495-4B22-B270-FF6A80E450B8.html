<p>The list below contains some common device security mechanisms.</p>
<div id="GUID-24AD1095-E039-46B5-A39A-1D814D697DA1"><h3 class="section-title">Device
protection</h3>
<p>Protection of the Symbian platform-based device against a physical
attack (that is, when an attacker has physical access to the mobile
device) is controlled by the device lock feature, which is not necessarily
often used. Other external methods of protection, like a PIN code
or Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) locking, tend to provide protection
only when accessing a cellular network, leaving the information content
vulnerable. Without <a href="GUID-A1ED2377-E196-423F-A5A2-1889C1CC3E05.html">cryptographic protection</a>, it is possible to gain access to the device's information storage
with hardware-based methods (for example, wiretapping connectors and
direct reading of memory chips).</p>
</div>
<div id="GUID-BE16A5D1-B580-4ED6-82D7-16B33B8EEADF"><h3 class="section-title">Device
authentication</h3>
<p>Sometimes, for security reasons, an application needs to identify
the mobile device it is running on, for example, to use specific ciphering
keys or to apply copy protection. Identification can be done by checking
the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code,
which is unique in each device used in cellular networks. To retrieve
the IMEI code, you can use, for example the <code class="codeph">CTelephony::GetPhoneId</code> method. For more information, see <a href="GUID-5E10D5B7-C407-51E0-8C16-466A8BC89106.html">Phone Identification
Tutorial</a>. There are different APIs for retrieving the IMEI
code in different versions of SDKs. Refer to the SDK API or Symbian
documentation for the proper method.</p>
<p>Another way to get information about the running platform and
the mobile device is to use the <code class="codeph">HAL:Get()</code> method
defined in <code class="codeph">hal.h</code> header file. For more information
and examples, see <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Device_Product_ID,_Platform_ID_and_HAL_information" target="_blank">Device Product ID, Platform ID and HAL information</a> at the Symbian Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>User authentication</strong></p>
<p>When powering on the device, the user is authenticated in the <em>operating system level</em> with standard device authentication methods,
such as a PIN code and security code requests. However, these features
can be turned off by the user and are easily reset with special hardware.
If an application needs to authenticate the user, it should be done
in the <em>application level</em> by implementing a separate user name/password
authentication mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div id="GUID-962E0183-0CBD-457D-B24C-C0BDB30A58A4"><h3 class="section-title">Mobile
hardware</h3>
<p>The Symbian platform attempts to ensure the integrity of data
even in the presence of unreliable communication and a shortage of
resources, such as memory, power, and storage.</p>
<p>The user may detach removable storage media at any time, either
intentionally or unintentionally. The platform has a built-in detach
handling mechanism, but applications should still be prepared for
a sudden loss of storage media to prevent data loss or corruption.
To check the type of storage media (removable/fixed), use the <code class="codeph">RFs::Drive()</code> method. </p>
<p>The device may shut down at any time, either by accident or
because the battery runs out. Important data stored in nonpermanent
memory should be written to permanent memory as early as possible.
To query the battery level, use the <code class="codeph">HAL::Get(EPowerBatteryStatus)</code> method. For information on how to retrieve system information, see
the Power HAL
Handler Tutorial.</p>
<p>Even though internal storage is not physically protected, you
can secure memory cards with password protection. If the locking option
is used (method <code class="codeph">RFs::LockDrive</code>), memory card contents
are protected with a password and cannot be read in any other device
without it. Password locking is an extended functionality of the Multimedia
card (MMC), and may not be compatible with all hardware and software
configurations.</p>
</div>
<div id="GUID-9058F379-C495-4B22-B270-FF6A80E450B9"><h3 class="section-title">Third-party
solutions</h3>
<p>A mobile device can be protected with third-party security applications. <em>Antivirus software</em> can detect and quarantine any viruses that
try to access the device, as well as restore infected files. Antivirus
software is usually used together with <em>firewalls</em> to observe
and protect both incoming and outgoing data connections. This enables
monitoring of important data and prevents it from being sent out of
the device. Firewall and antivirus software can also be part of an <em>intrusion detection system</em> that notifies the user whenever a
malicious attempt is detected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are applications you can use to encrypt existing
files, manage passwords, and store information and data securely (in
vaults). You can even cipher information in applications and connection
methods which do not initially support ciphering (for example, short
message service [SMS]).</p>
