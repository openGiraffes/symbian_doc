to open client applications. This topic outlines problems and suggests
solutions that Serial Port Contention raises with the C32 Serial Server
Client. </p>
<p>The Root Server process includes a server which allows access to
the serial ports of a device. This server is known as C32 Serial Server
and it sits on top of the Kernel RBusDevComm APIs.
The <code class="codeph">RBusDevComm</code> APIs provide access to the serial
ports. Serial port configuration is important because each device
has a specific hardware configuration and serial ports are highly
susceptible to contention issues. </p>
<div id="GUID-35BC2F4D-0B46-41EF-86E1-A623EE9FE99E"><h3 class="section-title">Serial
port co-operation and contention</h3> <p>The first client to open
a serial port effectively owns that port and can then choose to share
it or keep exclusive access. This logic can cause problems for C32
Serial server clients. C32 Serial server clients cannot use <code class="codeph">RBusDevComm</code> to track clients that use the serial ports directly.
In these circumstances, C32 can only see that the port is in use and
reports this to all of its clients. </p> <p>To ensure a specified
process can access a serial port, do one of the following: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-DA3D42DF-1E53-5811-83D4-79C9747D53C2"><a name="GUID-DA3D42DF-1E53-5811-83D4-79C9747D53C2"><!-- --></a><p>Configure the
device startup so that the specified process can open the serial port
before all other applications. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-F331356C-8C75-5651-8702-FB5E47FBAEF0"><a name="GUID-F331356C-8C75-5651-8702-FB5E47FBAEF0"><!-- --></a><p>Implement the
serial port driver so that only the specified process can access it.
For example, the driver might require that the client has a particular
process ID. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Both of these solutions require an understanding of the serial
port hardware and potential client software before the solutions can
be implemented. For C32 Serial Server the device boot order is very
important since it affects both solutions. </p> <p>The C32 Serial
Server is started after Root Server starts. The Root Server and C32
startups are specified in each associated CMI file. They are started
early in the boot process, but the serial ports might be ready for
use by <code class="codeph">RBusDevComm</code> at an earlier stage. If the strategy
of guaranteeing port access is based on the client opening the port
using the C32 Serial Server, then no other client can open a port
using RBusDevComm before C32 starts. </p> <p>The C32 Serial Server
loads plug-ins that act as high-level drivers for each serial port.
You can implement any requirements for access within these plug-ins,
such as requiring the client to have a specific process ID. This strategy
only works within the C32 Serial Server, since any client using the
serial port through <code class="codeph">RBusDevComm</code> does not load the
C32 Serial Server plug-in. </p> </div>
