to associate certain rights to the content objects for defining how
the content can be used. The Symbian platform supports the mandatory
features of the OMA DRM v1.0 specification.</p>
<p>The Symbian platform supports the following OMA DRM 1.0 features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Forward-lock</p></li>
<li><p>Combined delivery</p></li>
<li><p>Separate delivery</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Symbian platform supports time-based constraints
for automated content, such as background images, UI themes, ring
tones, and alarm tones. However, count-based constraints for automated
content are not allowed.</p>
<p>The protection of themes and native applications covers not only
the SIS package itself but also the data after the installation. The
protection is achieved through encrypting essential theme and application
data (chosen by the developer). Protected applications and themes
can make use of DRM mechanisms, such as expiry dates or online rights
refresh.</p>
<div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>For file formats that are not DRM protected, the forwarding
is restricted according to the closed content list.</p></div>
<p>Use the <a href="specs/guides/OMA_DRM_CAF_Agent_API_Specification/OMA_DRM_CAF_Agent_API_Specification.html#specs/guides/OMA_DRM_CAF_Agent_API_Specification/OMA_DRM_CAF_Agent_API_Specification.html">DRM CAF Agent API</a> to implement the OMA DRM v1.0
features in applications.</p>
<div id="GUID-32071397-5AFA-4FB2-BC9F-C4920B7BBC8C"><h3 class="section-title">Forward-lock</h3><p>Forward-lock is a simple mechanism that prevents content from
leaving the mobile device. It provides basic copy protection that
protects the rights of content owners. The content is delivered to
the device in a DRM message without associating a rights object to
the content. Forward-lock content can be opened and played freely
in the given device but cannot be forwarded or used in any other device.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-EF3B7671-9309-419A-ACC8-8C7FF266B9FA"><h3 class="section-title">Combined
delivery</h3><p>Combined delivery is similar to OMA forward-lock,
but additional usage rights can be added to the content, such as one-time
use, or use for a week. This allows the previewing of content, or
the adoption of various new business models by applying different
usage rights. The content and rights are delivered to the device within
the same DRM message. The device enforces the usage of the content
according to the rights. The device does not allow forwarding the
right or the content to any other device.</p><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>Forward-lock
and combined delivery protected content is received to the device
as plain text, but is encrypted as soon as it is received. After the
content has been encrypted, it can only be opened and consumed in
the device where it was originally downloaded.</p></div></div>
<div id="GUID-389B54FE-BCEF-4462-9513-147D4ED4565F"><h3 class="section-title">Separate
delivery</h3><p>Separate delivery is similar to combined delivery
but with added security. Content is delivered as encrypted files separately
from usage rights, which are delivered via a different channel. Separate
delivery also enables the superdistribution business model, in which
DRM-protected content can be sent from mobile device to mobile device,
for example sending the content as part of an MMS to a friend. The
recipient can then acquire a license to get a preview or buy the content.
This makes viral marketing a potentially powerful concept. </p><p>In separate delivery, the content is in the format defined in the
OMA DRM Content Format specification. The content is encrypted using
a symmetric encryption key called content encryption key (CEK). The
content can be decrypted only with the same key that has been used
for encryption. With separate delivery, the encrypted content is delivered
to the device separately from the rights (typically over HTTP download
or MMS). The rights object containing the CEK is delivered to the
device using connectionless WAP Push over SMS.</p><p>Symbian applications
that deal with combined delivery and separate delivery protected media
objects are capable of enforcing the usage rights constraints that
are defined in the rights objects. The applications are able to detect
when the usage rights related to a combined delivery and separate
delivery protected media object have become expired. </p><p>The content
provider can specify a timeout value for the delivery of the rights
object when delivering content over HTTP. The user is notified if
the rights object does not arrive within the specified time. The rights
object related to a separate delivery protected media object can also
be updated when it expires.</p> </div>
<div id="GUID-4F3BFECA-CBF4-4CFE-9C9D-EADFF4C47D0B"><h3 class="section-title">Supported
file types</h3><p>The file types that are defined in OMA DRM v1.0
correspond to the following delivery methods:</p><ul>
<li><p>Delivery message (.dm)</p><p>Contains the content. It is used
in both OMA forward-lock and combined delivery. In an OMA forward-lock
delivery message, the file contains only the protected content, whereas
in a combined delivery message, the file contains both the rights
(defined in ODRL) and the content. The MIME type for this file type
is <code class="codeph">application/vnd.oma.drm.message</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>DRM content format (.dcf)</p><p>Contains the encrypted content.
It is used in separate delivery where the content is encrypted into
the message without the rights. The key used to encrypt the content
is sent separately with the rights to the device. The MIME type for
this file type is <code class="codeph">application/vnd.oma.drm.content</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DRM rights object, binary (.drc)</p><p>Contains the rights
object, specified in binary, as well as the key used to encrypt the
content in the DCF file. The MIME type for this file type is <code class="codeph">application/vnd.oma.drm.rights+wbxml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>DRM rights object, clear text (.dr)</p><p>Contains the rights
object, specified in clear text, as well as the key used to encrypt
the content in the DCF file. The MIME type for this file type is <code class="codeph">application/vnd.oma.drm.rights+xml</code>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div id="GUID-AE6B6119-D209-4777-A6D8-EBF8B7D8DB6A"><h3 class="section-title">Downloading
DRM-protected files</h3><p>You can use the following methods to
download DRM-protected files:</p><ul>
<li><p>HTTP download</p></li>
<li><p>Multimedia messaging service (MMS)</p></li>
</ul><p>You can use the following methods to download files in the
DCF format:</p><ul>
<li><p>MMS</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP</p></li>
<li><p>Bluetooth</p></li>
<li><p>IrDa</p></li>
<li><p>Multimedia card (MMC)</p></li>
<li><p>E-mail</p></li>
<li><p>Any other connectivity method that supports file transfer</p></li>
