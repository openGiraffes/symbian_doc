<div id="GUID-528B2FD1-7233-413A-81C8-5064095135AB"><h3 class="section-title">Static
Startup Configuration</h3> <p>The System Starter is automatically
invoked as part of the boot process once the file system has been
mounted. It works by processing a list of instructions in sequence.
The list is referred to as a Static Startup Configuration, or SSC.
In practical terms the SSC is defined in a resource file and is built
into the ROM. </p> <p>A fundamental feature of the SSC is that it
allows the start up procedure to be optimised. Though the commands
are processed in sequence their effect is to perform tasks not only
in <strong>sequence</strong> (wait for the application or process to initialise
before continuing) but also in <strong>parallel</strong> (do not wait for initialisation)
and <strong>at the optimum time</strong> (wait until conditions are right). </p> <p>For further information on the contents of an SSC see: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-1F8911D9-F92B-5A4F-8548-942842A7ED2A"><a name="GUID-1F8911D9-F92B-5A4F-8548-942842A7ED2A"><!-- --></a><p><a href="GUID-57F38146-1DA3-5657-ADF4-76DF740363C5.html">Static Startup Configuration</a> </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Though an SSC cannot be changed, a number of SSCs may be
included in a ROM. This allows a device to be started with one of
a number of different configurations, i.e. to be booted into different <strong>modes</strong>. </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-92E0E027-8A4F-55A5-AC48-4252164E2E77"><a name="GUID-92E0E027-8A4F-55A5-AC48-4252164E2E77"><!-- --></a><p>The mode determines
which SSC the System Starter uses to start the system. Symbian has
defined (and reserved) a number of Startup Modes (for test and reference
purposes): Full, Emulator, Emergency, Battery charge &amp; Test.</p> </li>
</ul> <p>SSC files are named <code>SCCForStartupModeN.rss</code> where N is the number of the mode. The method of selecting the mode,
and therefore the SSC file, for each startup is defined by the licensee. </p> <p>The degree to which an SSC can control and optimise the boot
process is further enhanced by the concepts of <strong>Startup States</strong> and <strong>Staged Startup</strong>. </p> <p><strong> Startup States</strong> </p> <p>An SSC is divided into a series of states which follow each other
sequentially. Those described here are defined by Symbian. Licencees
may add or insert further states by defining them and including them
in an SSC. The Symbian defined states have a certain significance: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-4C3113C7-CFAF-59AE-A271-51424F6B2478"><a name="GUID-4C3113C7-CFAF-59AE-A271-51424F6B2478"><!-- --></a><p> <strong>The Critical
Static State:</strong> This is when the essential ROM based components
are started. Nothing started in this state relies on anything outside
the ROM. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-56754FF8-08A4-56BE-A4C2-A8F2A25AE738"><a name="GUID-56754FF8-08A4-56BE-A4C2-A8F2A25AE738"><!-- --></a><p> <strong> The Critical
Dynamic State:</strong> This is when essential non-ROM based components
and components which use non-ROM based files are started. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-804244EC-006E-5216-B286-D9FC6B9495EA"><a name="GUID-804244EC-006E-5216-B286-D9FC6B9495EA"><!-- --></a><p> <strong> The Non-critical
State:</strong> Components started here are not essential for the basic
functionality of the device. i.e. the phone will be 'up and running'
before these components are started. </p> </li>
</ul><p><strong>Staged Startup</strong> </p> <p>A further level of startup control
and configuration can be achieved using Staged Startup. This technique
enables components to perform their initialisation procedure as separate
stages - essential earlier, non-essential later. This enables further
reduction of the effective boot time. </p> <p>Applications must be <strong>Staged Startup Aware (SSA)</strong> to take advantage of the staged startup
facilities. They must register with the Starter so that they can receive
state-change notifications. An SSA application may perform a <strong>stage</strong> of its startup during each SSC <strong>state</strong>. </p> <p>Staged startup
subdivides each state into five ordered domains: Kernel, Base, OS
Services, Application Services and UI Framework (these correspond
to the Symbian System Model). Each SSA component associates itself
with a domain according to its location in the System Model. Within
each state the domains are processed sequentially. This allows application
dependency to be accommodated without individual applications having
to manage these dependencies. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-F58AE201-31BF-4E36-96B6-50D61A53B9CA"><h3 class="section-title">Dynamic
Startup Configuration (DSC) </h3> <p>All of the components included
in the Static Startup Configuration are present for the life of the
device. Components installed after the ROM has been built, or after
the device has been shipped, may also be started during boot by being
added to a Dynamic Startup Configuration (DSC). </p> <p>One or more
DSCs may be included at various points in an SSC. </p> <p>A run-time
API allows entries to be added to and deleted from a DSC. This means
that aftermarket applications, updates and patches can be inserted
automatically on installation, over the air by a Network Operator,
or by the user. </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-84D36270-880B-56F4-BBD9-5C80F9DA1BEF"><a name="GUID-84D36270-880B-56F4-BBD9-5C80F9DA1BEF"><!-- --></a><p>How to use the DSC

<div id="GUID-D6D28700-0BAD-4F88-8CE9-2E0330233468"><h3 class="section-title">Specifying
action on failure </h3> <p>Though system startup is an automatic
process, things can go wrong. In some cases the device can continue
to function if a component fails to start, in others it cannot. Applications
can fail to start or fail after they have started for a variety of
reasons. Symbian provides mechanisms for detecting and handling failure. </p> <p>When an application is started using an SSC or a DSC several
parameters must be specified in its resource. These include: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-4DC8B8DA-FA50-57E9-B1FD-B60991C927C1"><a name="GUID-4DC8B8DA-FA50-57E9-B1FD-B60991C927C1"><!-- --></a><p>a startup method

</ul> <p>If, after the <strong>timeout period</strong> the application has not
made its rendezvous, the platform can make further attempts to start
it. If, after the <strong>number of retries</strong> specified, it has not succeeded
it will take the specified <strong>restart action</strong>. If the restart action
is <code class="codeph">ERestartOS</code> or <code class="codeph">ERestartOSWithMode</code> it will shut down the device and restart it (in the second case
in the <strong>restart mode</strong> specified). If <strong>monitoring</strong> is enabled
the System Monitor will continue to monitor the process after a successful
rendezvous and, if it stops unexpectedly at any time, will re-use
the same configuration information and act accordingly. </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-64BFBF8C-3279-5DE5-9350-19DB7FD5D481"><a name="GUID-64BFBF8C-3279-5DE5-9350-19DB7FD5D481"><!-- --></a><p><a href="GUID-4E195F2A-78AE-5664-A115-AD65BF457AB1.html">How to use the System
Monitor</a> </p> </li>
</ul> <p>Note that processes or threads declared 'System Critical'
use an aternative monitoring mechanism, which pre-dates the System
Monitor, to restart the platform, when they fail (see <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B0E661BC-4058-3256-B9C3-5A4FD52F6DE5.html#GUID-AF3E8BE4-FE65-3CCE-8B5A-6C4585BEA2EC"><code class="apiname">RThread::SetCritical()</code></a>). The System Monitor offers two significant advantages: the ability
to restart the process without restarting the platform, and the option
of restarting in a specified mode. </p> </div>
