and operation of SQLite</h3> <p>The figure below shows the major modules
within SQLite. SQL statements that are to be processed are sent to the SQL
Compiler module which does a syntactic and semantic analysis of the SQL statements
and generates bytecode for carrying out the work of each statement. The generated
bytecode is then handed over to a Virtual Machine for evaluation. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-370A849E-D1CC-5510-9211-D732C2D1DF6B"><img src="GUID-D3881E09-4519-5E3F-9978-C9FEFD123B85_d0e463176_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>              Simplified SQLite Architecture            </p></div> <p>The Virtual Machine considers the database to be a set of B-Trees,
one B-Tree for each table and one B-Tree for each index. The logic for creating,
reading, writing, updating, balancing and destroying B-Trees is contained
in the B-Tree module. </p> <p>The B-Tree module uses the Pager module to access
individual pages of the database file. The Pager module abstracts the database
file into zero or more fixed-sized pages with atomic commit and rollback semantics. </p> <p>All
interaction with the underlying file system and operating system occurs through
the OS Adaptation Layer. </p> <p id="GUID-9AEF6B71-B6B6-5A83-9ED2-547BB60A6752"><a name="GUID-9AEF6B71-B6B6-5A83-9ED2-547BB60A6752"><!-- --></a><strong>SQL Statements as Computer
Programs</strong> </p> <p>A key to understanding the operation of SQLite, or any
other SQL relational database engine, is to recognize that each statement
of SQL is really a small computer program. </p> <p>Users of SQL database engines
sometimes fail to grasp this simple truth because SQL is a peculiar programming
language. In most other computer languages the programmer must specify exactly <em>how</em> a
computation is to take place. But in SQL the programmer specifies <em>what</em> results
are needed and lets the SQL Compiler worry about how to achieve them. </p> <p>All
SQL database engines contain a SQL Compiler of some kind. The job of this
compiler is to convert SQL statements into procedural programs for obtaining
the desired result. Most SQL database engines translate SQL statements into
tree structures. The Virtual Machine modules of these databases then walk
these tree structures to evaluate the SQL statements. A few SQL database engines
translate SQL statements into native machine code. </p> <p>SQLite takes an
intermediate approach and translates SQL statements into small programs written
in a bytecode language. The SQLite bytecode is similar in concept to Java
bytecode, the parrot bytecode of Perl, or to the p-code of the UCSD Pascal
implementation. SQLite bytecode consists of operators that work with values
contained in registers or on a stack. Typical bytecode operators do things
like: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-75B81AB2-56C8-5D76-AA4C-D2E1CBF3B868"><a name="GUID-75B81AB2-56C8-5D76-AA4C-D2E1CBF3B868"><!-- --></a><p>Push a literal value
onto the stack </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-4E4C868D-18BD-5B2C-9188-8303EEA062B7"><a name="GUID-4E4C868D-18BD-5B2C-9188-8303EEA062B7"><!-- --></a><p>Pop two numbers off
of the stack, add them together and push the result back onto the stack </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-1B17CC17-D06C-5883-AC1C-768E87E60BF0"><a name="GUID-1B17CC17-D06C-5883-AC1C-768E87E60BF0"><!-- --></a><p>Move the top element
of the stack into a specific memory register </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-B475E9E0-FE03-5C1F-9C2E-F35C866D53B3"><a name="GUID-B475E9E0-FE03-5C1F-9C2E-F35C866D53B3"><!-- --></a><p>Jump to a specific instruction
if the top element of the stack is zero </p> </li>
</ul> <p>The SQLite bytecode supports about 125 different opcodes. There is
a remarkable resemblance between SQLite bytecode and assembly language. The
major difference is that SQLite bytecode contains a few specialized opcodes
designed to facilitate database operations that commonly occur in SQL. </p> <p>Just
as you do not need to understand the details of x86 or ARM7 assembly language
in order to make effective use of C++, so also you do not need to know any
of the details of SQLite bytecode in order to make the best use of SQLite.
The reader need only recognize that the bytecode is there and is being used
behind the scenes. </p> <p>Those who are interested can peruse the definitions
of the bytecodes in the SQLite documentation. But the details of the various
bytecodes are not important to making optimal use of SQLite and so no further
details on the bytecodes will be provided in this document. </p> <p id="GUID-AFB97D35-56B8-5B12-8B6A-0AC6A4DC9088"><a name="GUID-AFB97D35-56B8-5B12-8B6A-0AC6A4DC9088"><!-- --></a><strong>The B-Tree Module</strong> </p> <p>A
SQLite database file consists of one or more b-trees. Each table and each
index is a separate b-tree. </p> <p>A b-tree is a data structure discovered
in 1970 by Rudolf Bayer and Edward McCreight and is widely used in the implementation
of databases. B-trees provide an efficient means of organizing data stored
on an external storage device with fixed-sized blocks, such as a disk drive
or a flash memory card. Each entry in a b-tree has a unique key and arbitrary
data. The entries are ordered by their key which permits efficient lookup
using a binary search. The b-tree algorithm guarantees worst-case insert,
update, and access times of O(log N) where N is the number of entries. </p> <p>In
SQLite, each table is a separate b-tree and each row of the table is a separate
entry. The b-tree key is the RowID or INTEGER PRIMARY KEY for the row and
other columns in the row are stored in the data for the b-tree entry. Tables
use a variant of the b-tree algorithm call <em>b+trees</em> in which all data
is stored on the leaves of the tree. </p> <p>Indexes are also stored as b-trees
with one entry in the b-tree for each row of the table being indexed. The
b-tree key is composed of the values for the columns being indexed followed
by the RowID of the corresponding row in the table. Indexes do not use the
data part of the b-tree entry. Indexes use the original Bayer and McCreight
b-tree algorithm, not b+trees as tables do. </p> <p>The number of pages in
a b-tree can grow and shrink as information is inserted and removed. When
new information is inserted and the b-tree needs to grow, the B-Tree Module
may reuse pages in the database that have fallen into disuse or it may ask
the Pager module to allocate new pages at the end of the database file to
accommodate this growth. When a b-tree shrinks and pages are no longer needed,
the surplus pages are added to a <em>free-list</em> to be reused by future page
requests. The B-Tree module takes care of managing this free-list of unused
pages. </p> <p id="GUID-640FDE57-C615-55AF-9579-79B0D718A78E"><a name="GUID-640FDE57-C615-55AF-9579-79B0D718A78E"><!-- --></a><strong>The Pager Module</strong> </p> <p>The
Pager module (also called simply “the pager”) manages the reading and writing
of raw data from the database file such that reads are always consistent and
isolated and so that writes are atomic. </p> <p>The pager treats the database
file as a sequence of zero or more fixed-size pages. A typical page size might
be 1024 bytes. Within a single database all pages are the same size. The first
page of a database file is called page 1. The second is page 2. There is no
page 0. SQLite uses a page number of 0 internally to mean “no such page”. </p> <p>When
the B-Tree module needs a page of data from the database file, it asks for
the page by number from the pager. The pager then returns a pointer to the
requested data. The pager keeps a cache of recently accessed database pages
so in many cases no disk I/O has to occur to fulfil a page request. </p> <p>The
B-Tree module notifies the pager before making any changes to a page and the
pager then saves a copy of the original page content in a rollback journal
file. The rollback journal is used to restore the database to its original
state if a ROLLBACK occurs. </p> <p>After making changes to one or more pages,
the B-Tree Module may ask the pager to commit those changes. The pager then
goes through a carefully designed sequence of steps that ensure that changes
to the database are atomic. If the update process is interrupted by a program
crash, a system crash, or even a power failure, the next time the database
is accessed it will appear that either all the changes were made or else none
of them. </p> <p id="GUID-3C970D41-7611-5AF6-B5B4-C486B5DA3875"><a name="GUID-3C970D41-7611-5AF6-B5B4-C486B5DA3875"><!-- --></a><strong>Database File Format Summary</strong> </p> <p>A
SQLite database file consists of one or more fixed-sized pages. The first
page contains a 100-byte header that identifies the file as a SQLite database
and which contains operating parameters such as the page size, a file format
version number, the first page of the free-list, flags indicating whether
or not autovacuum is enabled, and so forth. </p> <p>The content of the database
is stored in one or more b-trees. Each b-tree has <em>root </em> page which
never moves. If the table or index is small enough to fit entirely on the
root page, then that one page contains everything there is to know about the
table or index. But most tables and indexes require more space and additional
pages must be allocated. </p> <p>The root page contains pointers (actually
page numbers) to the other pages in the b-tree. So given the root page of
a b-tree that implements a table or index, the B-Tree module is able to follow
pointers to locate any entry in the b-tree and thus any row in the corresponding
table or index. </p> <div class="p"><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong> Auxiliary pages of a b-tree can be allocated
from anywhere within the database file and so the pages numbers of auxiliary
pages will change as information is added and removed from the b-tree. But
the root page never moves. When a new table or index is created, its root
page is assigned and remains unchanged for the lifetime of the table or index.</p></div> </div> <p>Every
SQLite database contains a master table which stores the database schema.
Each row of the master table holds information about a single table, index,
view or trigger, including the original <code class="codeph">CREATE</code> statement
that created that table, index, view or trigger. Rows that define tables and
indexes also record the root page number for the b-tree that stores the table
or index. The root page of the master table is always page 1 of the database
file, so SQLite always knows how to locate it. And from the master table it
can learn the root page of every other table and index in the database and
thus locate any information in the database. </p> <p id="GUID-72EACB86-5E22-5DF1-A7E6-1233DC647867"><a name="GUID-72EACB86-5E22-5DF1-A7E6-1233DC647867"><!-- --></a><strong>An Example of SQLite in
Operation</strong> </p> <p>This is what happens inside SQLite during a typical
usage scenario: When the SQL server instructs SQLite to open a database, the
SQLite library allocates a data structure to hold everything it will ever
need to know about that database connection. It also asks the pager to open
the database file, but does not immediately try to read anything or even verify
that the file is a valid database. </p> <p>The first time you actually try
to access the database, SQLite will look at the 100-byte header of the database
file to verify that the file is a SQLite database and to extract operating
parameters such as the database page size. </p> <p>After checking the header
SQLite opens and reads the entire master table. Recall that the master table
contains entries for every table, index, view and trigger in the database
and that each entry includes the complete text of the <code class="codeph">CREATE</code> statement
that originally created the table, index, view or trigger. </p> <p>SQLite
parses these <code class="codeph">CREATE</code> statements in order to rebuild an internal
symbol table holding the names and properties of all tables, indexes, triggers
and views in the database schema. </p> <p>Among the values stored in the header
of the database is a 32-bit <em>schema cookie</em>. The schema cookie is changed
whenever the database schema is modified by creating or dropping a table,
index, trigger, or view. </p> <p>When SQLite parses the database schema into
its internal symbol table, it remembers the schema cookie. Thereafter, whenever
SQLite goes to access the database file, it first compares the schema cookie
that it read when it parsed the schema to the current schema cookie value. </p> <p>If
they match, everything continues normally, but if the schema cookie has changed
that means that some other thread or process may have modified the database
schema. When that happens, SQLite has to throw out its internal symbol table
and reread and re-parse the entire database schema in order to figure out
what might have changed. </p> <p> <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-0176BF07-DF94-3259-8F90-DE030E35CE9A.html#GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-0176BF07-DF94-3259-8F90-DE030E35CE9A.html"><code class="apiname"> RSqlStatement</code></a> ’s <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-0176BF07-DF94-3259-8F90-DE030E35CE9A.html#GUID-DF9C2258-9BAA-38F0-9B11-21CD00316912"><code class="apiname">RSqlStatement::Prepare()</code></a> API
