and terms</h3> <dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Points, twips and pixels</dt>
<dd><p>Points (1/72th inch) and twips (a twentieth of a point) are
absolute measurements of distance and specify device-independent size.
Pixel sizes are only relevant for a specific graphics device. Each
graphics device (screen or printer) must provide a mechanism for converting
between pixels and twips. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Font</dt>
<dd><p>A named set of characters of matching size (height) and <strong>font style</strong> (normal, bold, italic, underline). <strong>Times Roman
14 point bold</strong> is an example of a font. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Typeface</dt>
<dd><p>A group of fonts with similar appearance. The typeface does
not include the size or font style. <strong>Times</strong> is an example of
a typeface. Typefaces are sometimes referred to as <strong>font families</strong>. </p> <p>Typefaces are grouped generically as mono-spaced, variable
width, serif, sans-serif and symbol. This allows the grouping of typefaces
that have similar characteristics, so that an alternative font can
be selected when an exact match is not found. This means that applications
can display text relatively accurately when a specific font is not
available. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">OpenType font </dt>
<dd><p>A font that is stored as vector data, which can be rasterized
to any pixel size. OpenType fonts are sometimes simply called <strong>open
fonts</strong>. An open font can only be used with a corresponding font
rasterizer. The <a href="GUID-A03FB1BF-F67B-519D-A904-74CA3F8375D9.html">Font and Bitmap Server</a> caches rasterized fonts into bitmap
form. </p> <p>OpenType is an open source vector font format, which
is similar to TrueType. Like TrueType fonts, OpenType fonts can contain
font hinting information. However the font rasterizer's use of the
font hinting information in OpenType fonts is restricted by a software
patent. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Character</dt>
<dd><p>A single element (such as a letter, number, ligature, symbol
or punctuation mark) of written language. Each character has a unique
number (its <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html" target="_blank">Unicode</a> code point). </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Glyph</dt>
<dd><p>A graphical representation of a character in a specific font.
The mapping between a character and a glyph is not always direct.
For example, a character may be represented by different glyphs, depending
on the context. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Font metrics</dt>
<dd><p>Measurements (such as maximum height) that are common to all
of the characters in a font. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Character metrics</dt>
<dd><p>Measurements (such as character width) that apply to an individual
character within a font. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Bitmap font</dt>
<dd><p>A font stored as bitmap glyphs. The size of a font is described
in pixels. However, the actual size is dependent on the pixel size
of the graphics device. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Rasterizing</dt>
<dd><p>The process of converting drawing instructions into bitmap
data. Fonts provided in vector form (OpenType fonts) must be rasterized
into fixed size fonts before they can be used. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Linked font</dt>
<dd><p>A virtual font or typeface created from characters from other
fonts. The component fonts must be open fonts or other linked fonts.
Linked fonts are typically used where a preferred font does not contain
all of the characters in the character set. One of the typefaces in
a linked font must be designated as the principal typeface from which
any unspecified default metrics or characters are used. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Contextual shaping</dt>
<dd><p>In some scripts some characters are drawn differently depending
on the adjacent characters. This means that different glyphs are used
to represent a particular character in different contexts. Contextual
shaping is the selection of the appropriate glyph from several glyphs
that represent a particular character depending on the context. </p> <p>In Latin scripts, contextual shaping is normally used only when
simulating handwriting. For example, the glyph used for the letter <strong>p</strong> might depend on whether the letter is at the start, middle
or end of a word, as shown in the following diagram. For example,
when it is in the middle of the word, it might have a "tail" on both
sides to join it to the letters that appear before and after. </p> <div class="figure" id="GUID-30A9DA99-E1C5-5EE5-AEB3-0BCD6DB0A692"><img src="GUID-8F19C257-9A41-5D38-BC8A-285D0EB16E1B_d0e466283_href.png" /><p class="figure-title"><strong>Figure: </strong>                   Figure 1: Handwriting simulation might use
different glyphs for                   the letter p depending on its
position in a word                  </p></div> <p>Contextual shaping is an essential feature of some scripts,
including Arabic and many Indian and East Asian scripts, such as Devanagari,
Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, Malayalam and Gurmukhi. For this
reason, support for contextual shaping is sometimes referred to as <strong>Brahmic support</strong>. </p> </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Text shaper</dt>
<dd><p>A plug-in that performs the contextual shaping for scripts
that require this feature. Text shapers are font and language specific. </p> </dd>

<dd><p>A default font that is used when no font is specified. </p> </dd>

by the Font Store while the phone is running. However, font rasterizers
can only be installed by restarting the phone. If a new font requires
