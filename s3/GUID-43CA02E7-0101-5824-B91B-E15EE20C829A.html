tables.</p>
<div id="GUID-191FA663-E058-49EF-A514-008C2755CAC2"><h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3> <p>Transient tables are nameless entities that exist for the duration
of a single SQL statement and are automatically deleted at the conclusion
of the statement. It is best to avoid queries that need transient
tables. </p> <p><strong>Intended audience:</strong> </p> <p>This document is intended to be
used by Symbian platform licensees and third party application developers. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-62920E16-50D3-504A-9E8C-B835CF374A8B"><h3 class="section-title">Avoid
Queries that Require Transient Tables</h3> <p>Complex queries sometimes
require SQLite to compute intermediate results that are stored in <em>transient tables</em>. Transient tables are nameless entities that
exist for the duration of a single SQL statement and are automatically
deleted at the conclusion of the statement. </p> <p>We use the term
transient to describe these tables rather than temporary to avoid
confusion with TEMP tables. TEMP tables are tables that are private
to a particular database connection and which persist for the duration
of that database connection. TEMP tables have names and work like
regular tables with the exceptions that they are only visible to the
current database connection and are automatically deleted when the
connection is closed. Transient tables, in contrast, are invisible
internal holding areas for intermediate results that exist only until
the end of the current SQL statement. </p> <p>Transient tables will
be stored either in RAM or on disk depending on device configuration.
The Symbian default configuration is to store transient tables on
disk although downstream device manufacturers may alter this. </p> <p>When configured to store transient tables on disk, in reality
a combination of memory and file space is used to hold the table.
Transient tables go through the same page cache mechanism that regular
database files go through. So as long as the transient tables do not
grow too large, they will always be held in memory in the page cache
rather than being written to disk. Information is only written to
disk when the cache overflows. </p> <p>When transient tables are configured
to be stored in memory rather than in a file, the cache is considered
infinitely large and will never overflow and thus nothing will ever
be written out to the file system. Storing transient tables in memory
rather than in files avoids the overhead of file I/O but requires
potentially unbounded amounts of memory. Using file-based transient
tables puts an upper bound on the amount of memory required but adds
file I/O overhead. </p> <p>One strategy for dealing with transient
tables is to avoid them all together. If you never use transient tables
then it does not really matter if they are stored in memory or on
disk. The remainder of this section will enumerate all of the things
that might provoke SQLite to create a transient table. If you avoid
all of these things in your code, then you never need to worry about
where your transient tables are stored. </p> <p>A transient table
is created whenever you use the DISTINCT keyword in a query: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM artist;
</pre> <p>The DISTINCT keyword guarantees that each row of the
result set will be different from all other rows. In order to enforce
this SQLite creates a transient table that stores all prior output
rows from the query. If a new row can be found in the transient table
then the new row is skipped. The same situation occurs when DISTINCT
is used within an aggregate function: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT avg(DISTINCT cnt) FROM playlist;
</pre> <p>In this context the DISTINCT keyword means that the
aggregate function is only applied to distinct elements of the result.
As before, a transient table is used to record prior values of the
result so that SQLite can tell if new results have been seen before. </p> <p>The UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operators used to create compound
queries always generate a distinct set of rows. Even though the DISTINCT
keyword does not appear, it is implied for these connectors, and a
transient table is used to enforce the distinctness. In contrast,
the UNION ALL operator does not require a transient table. </p> <p>A transient table might be used to implement an ORDER BY or GROUP
BY clause. SQLite always tries to use an index to satisfy an ORDER
BY or GROUP BY clause if it can. But if no indexes are available which
can satisfy the ORDER BY or GROUP BY, then the entire results set
is loaded into a transient table and sorted there. </p> <p>Subqueries
on the right-hand side of the IN operator use a transient table. Consider
an example: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT * FROM ex334a WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM ex334b WHERE amt&gt;7);
</pre> <p>The results of the (SELECT id FROM ex334b WHERE amt&gt;7)
subquery are stored in a transient table. Then the value of the <em>id</em> column is checked against this table for each row of the outer
query to determine if that row should be included in the result set. </p> <p>Sometimes subqueries in the FROM clause of a query will result
in a transient table. This is not always the case because SQLite tries
very hard to convert subqueries in the FROM clause into a join that
does not use subqueries. SQLite uses the term <em>flattening</em> to
describe the conversion of FROM clause subqueries into joins. Flattening
is an optimization that makes queries run faster. But in some cases,
flattening cannot occur. When the flattening optimization is inhibited,
the results of the subqueries are stored in transient tables and then
a separate query is run against those transient tables to generate
the final results. </p> <p>Consider the following schema and query: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c);
CREATE TABLE t2(x,y,z);
SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN (SELECT x,y FROM t2);
</pre> <p>The subquery in the FROM clause is plainly visible
in the SELECT statement above. But if the subquery were disguised
as a view, it might be less noticeable. A view is really just a macro
that serves as a place-holder for a subquery. So the SELECT statement
above is equivalent to the following: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE VIEW v2 AS SELECT x, y FROM t2;
SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN v2;
</pre> <p>In either case above, whether the subquery is stated
explicitly or is implied by the use of a view, flattening occurs and
the query is converted into this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT a,b,c,x,y FROM t1 JOIN t2;
</pre> <p>Had flattening not occurred, it would have been necessary
to evaluate the v2 view or the subquery into a transient table then
execute the outer query using the transient table as one of the two
tables in the join. SQLite prefers to flatten the query because a
flattened query generally uses fewer resources and is better able
to take advantage of indexes. The rules for determining when flattening
occurs and when it does not are complex. Flattening occurs if all
of the following conditions in the outer query and in the subquery
are satisfied: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-C2006064-D688-50F2-BDAA-0903746BBDCA"><a name="GUID-C2006064-D688-50F2-BDAA-0903746BBDCA"><!-- --></a><p>The subquery

<li id="GUID-55523D18-9421-582C-8CB4-601BC6BBA8A0"><a name="GUID-55523D18-9421-582C-8CB4-601BC6BBA8A0"><!-- --></a><p>The subquery

</ul> <p>Nobody really expects a programmer to memorize or even understand
the above set of flattening rules. As a short-cut, perhaps it is best
to remember that a complicated subquery or view in the FROM clause
of a complicated query might defeat the flattening optimization and
thus require the use of transient tables. </p> <p>One other obscure
use of transient tables is when there is an INSTEAD OF DELETE or INSTEAD
OF UPDATE trigger on a view. When such triggers exists and a DELETE
or an UPDATE is executed against that view then a transient table
is created which stores copies of the rows to be deleted or updated.
Since it is unusual to have INSTEAD OF triggers in the first place
this case rarely arises. </p> <p>In summary, transient tables are
used to implement the following features: </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-AA436587-D5B8-57A4-A256-AA255B316086"><a name="GUID-AA436587-D5B8-57A4-A256-AA255B316086"><!-- --></a><p>The DISTINCT
keyword or other situations where distinct results are required such
as compound queries using UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-84FC9506-4E85-5F7E-A96A-45EC239360DA"><a name="GUID-84FC9506-4E85-5F7E-A96A-45EC239360DA"><!-- --></a><p>ORDER BY or
GROUP BY clauses that cannot be satisfied by indexes. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-59EAEE54-98A0-5647-B4E4-9A213342D46D"><a name="GUID-59EAEE54-98A0-5647-B4E4-9A213342D46D"><!-- --></a><p>Subqueries on
the right-hand side of the IN operator. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-BCB93FF3-F959-5292-A3D7-C23CD436DC4E"><a name="GUID-BCB93FF3-F959-5292-A3D7-C23CD436DC4E"><!-- --></a><p>Subqueries or
views in the FROM clause of a query that cannot be flattened. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-552BE4BC-2242-5E26-85C0-20CB99C188A1"><a name="GUID-552BE4BC-2242-5E26-85C0-20CB99C188A1"><!-- --></a><p>DELETE or UPDATE
against a view with INSTEAD OF triggers. </p> </li>
</ul> <p>The resource-limited nature of the environment, where file
I/O is expensive and memory is scarce, means you will be well served
to avoid these constructs and thus avoid the need for transient tables. </p> </div>
