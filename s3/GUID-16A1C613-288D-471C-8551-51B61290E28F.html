for applications to start. This document summarizes the techniques
for optimizing application start-up time.</p>
<div id="GUID-4585EAA0-4169-4C5C-A7AD-AAA7FDA529C6"><h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3> <p>The techniques discussed in this document
are limited in scope to application programming. In other words, they
do not require modification of any core OS components or servers.
Some of the techniques are general good practice and are useful to
developers at all levels. </p> <p>The techniques can be summarized
as follows:</p><ul>
<li><p>Avoid causing unnecessary code to be executed as an effect
of your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Defer construction of objects, loading of dynamic libraries
(for example, the application model), and starting servers until you
need to use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Write efficient code!</p></li>
</ul><div class="note"><p><strong class="note_title">Note: </strong>There is an inevitable trade-off between shortening the
start-up time and introducing latency elsewhere in the application.
For example, if you don’t connect to a server at start-up, you will
have to do it later on, when the application needs to use the server.
This may be overcome by a central component that coordinates background
connections, or construction, such as the view server.</p></div></div>
<div id="GUID-818EB735-F408-47D9-9759-A180766996B4"><h3 class="section-title">Measure
start-up time before you start optimizing</h3><p>Do not assume
you know which methods take the most time. Pay close attention to
iterative and recursive operations. Many useful tools and techniques
are available to help identify poorly performing code:</p><ul>
<li><p>Software analysis tools, for instance <a href="http://www.glowcode.com/" target="_blank">GlowCode</a> and
MetroWerks <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/MW/Develop/AMC/CodeTEST/default.htm" target="_blank">CodeTEST</a></p></li>
<li><p>The Symbian profiling tool, profiler.exe, which is supplied
on DevKits </p></li>
<li><p>The RDebug class provides some profiling functions </p></li>
<li><p>The TTime class can be used to time blocks of code, but beware
of context switches, otherwise you may end up timing other threads!</p></li>
<li><p>Deliberately slowing down suspect blocks of code can reveal
whether or not optimizing it would bring a significant performance
improvement. </p></li>
</ul></div>
<div id="GUID-594EC7CB-3477-4D0F-B489-8C1A42ED0789"><h3 class="section-title">Defer
construction of the application model and other data members</h3><p>Many applications instantiate their components, for instance error
handlers, dialogs and menus, during start-up. In turn, each of these
components may instantiate other components, for instance menu resources
and icons. This can bring some benefits, for instance reducing application
complexity, revealing memory allocation problems at start-up rather
than after the application has been running for some time and improving
the runtime performance of the application. However, to minimize application
start-up time, it is recommended to avoid this behavior. Your goal
should be to only do what is immediately necessary during start-up. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-F7BE9B30-1993-4736-9E88-F0E065BE1A3C"><h3 class="section-title">Draw
the application as quickly as possible</h3><p>During application
start-up, only construct UI components that appear in the application’s
initial view. This applies especially to the application's implementations
of <code class="codeph">CXxxApplication::CreateDocumentL()</code>, <code class="codeph">CXxxDocument::ConstructL()</code> and <code class="codeph">CXxxDocument::CreateAppUiL()</code>, all of which
are called before <code class="codeph">CXxxAppUi::ConstructL()</code>. Do not
read bitmaps, resources, or any other data associated with the UI
from files unless it is necessary.</p><p>In <code class="codeph">CXxxAppUi::ConstructL()</code>, make sure <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-C79D0B6F-C2D7-3F22-A62B-88762092E869"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::ActivateL()</code></a> and <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-D5458F8C-E199-37DD-B821-050B749122C6"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawNow()</code></a> are called on all controls that
must be drawn when the application is launched. Also ensure that the
client-side window server command buffer is flushed by calling <code class="codeph">Flush()</code> on the application's window server session. This
ensures that there aren't any drawing commands left in the client-side
buffer, after <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-D5458F8C-E199-37DD-B821-050B749122C6"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawNow()</code></a> has completed. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-B320F7A3-C0E3-4A3D-8B45-AEFEDFBAAD2E"><h3 class="section-title">Minimize
the number of bitmaps used by GUI components</h3><p>Often, when
a large number of small images are required by an application, the
overhead associated with loading each bitmap outweighs any benefit
associated with their size. Some possible ways to avoid this are: </p><ul>
<li><p>use text instead, </p></li>
<li><p>for very simple graphics, draw directly using drawing primitives
rather than loading a bitmap,  </p></li>
<li><p>concatenate many small bitmaps into one large bitmap file to
reduce the need to search for and load multiple files.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div id="GUID-F00BA3FF-D9BD-44DF-A284-BAF5701179D8"><h3 class="section-title">Reduce
the number of redraws</h3><p>Some GUI components redraw themselves
every time their data changes. This may not always be necessary. Complicated
GUI components should implement their<code class="codeph">Draw()</code> method
to only update the area of the screen that has changed. For example,
there is no point in redrawing a whole list box every time a new item
is appended to it. In such cases, a GUI API should allow you to switch
off redrawing. Beware of GUI methods that cause the object they are
called upon to redraw itself.</p><p>Use <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-9FB682AC-0209-302A-83F3-7BCB1162B998"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawDeferred()</code></a> in preference to <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-D5458F8C-E199-37DD-B821-050B749122C6"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawNow()</code></a> if possible,
because excessive use of <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-D5458F8C-E199-37DD-B821-050B749122C6"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawNow()</code></a> can cause GUI flicker. For an explanation, see the documentation
for <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-B06F99BD-F032-3B87-AB26-5DD6EBE8C160.html#GUID-9FB682AC-0209-302A-83F3-7BCB1162B998"><code class="apiname">CCoeControl::DrawDeferred()</code></a>. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-71443827-BF8D-4BD8-8136-5023B6D65204"><h3 class="section-title">Use
ROM-based bitmaps rather than filestore bitmaps</h3><p>Uncompressed
ROM-based bitmaps that can be used in place from ROM are approximately
three times faster to use than filestore bitmaps. Using them can bring
a significant reduction in application start-up time.</p><p>Specifying
bitmap= instead of file= in the .OBY and .IBY files when building
the ROM causes bitmaps to be uncompressed before inclusion in the
ROM. Other bitmaps need to be uncompressed at runtime, which impacts
performance.   </p><p>The drawback of such bitmaps is that they are
large (up to 3 times larger than file based) and cannot be compressed,
although decompressing bitmaps should probably be avoided during start-up
anyway due to the extra processing required.   </p><p>If ROM space
is limited, consider using such ROM-based bitmaps only if they are
displayed during application start-up. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-5FFD3311-DF8D-4EB1-9C76-EB9F3D306655"><h3 class="section-title">Color
depth matching</h3><p>When bitmaps are drawn to the screen, optimum
performance is achieved by ensuring that:</p><code class="codeph">Bitmap color
depth = Window color depth = Screen device color depth </code><p>If this is the case, no palette mapping between the different color
depths is needed. On real hardware, this optimization has been found
to improve drawing speed by up to ten times. However, in order to
match the screen and window color depth, bitmaps may need to increase
in size and so this optimization is only possible if the increase
in ROM or RAM usage is acceptable. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-5E89E812-4B22-4B5C-A5E4-5FBE6619DC25"><h3 class="section-title">Minimize
access to the file system</h3><p>The file server can be a major
bottleneck during start-up when virtually all threads are searching
for and loading data, libraries and plug-ins. Therefore reducing file
access is one of the most effective ways to improve performance. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-9218ABF0-4062-439A-A5E9-273D76D4B711"><h3 class="section-title">Minimize
the use of resource files</h3><p>Resource files are used for localization
and allow modifications to be made to an application without the need
to rebuild it, but they are expensive to use because they require
access to the file system. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-C1CCFD4F-5C63-47C4-A312-38ACB5C16676"><h3 class="section-title">Do
not specify a default document filename for non document-based applications</h3><p>Many applications on a smartphone do not need to use documents,
for example Telephony, Contacts (this uses the contacts database),
Browser and Messaging.   </p><p>By not specifying a default document
filename, hundreds of milliseconds can potentially be saved from such
applications' start-up time.   </p><p>If an application uses a document
file, application start-up may involve the following steps: </p><ul>
<li><p>reading the name of the last used document file from the application’s
.ini file,</p></li>
<li><p>opening the document file, or if one doesn't exist, creating
a default document file, after reading its name from the application's
resource file, </p></li>
<li><p>writing the name of the last used file to the application’s
.ini file (which is created if it doesn’t exist),  </p></li>
<li><p>writing an entry to the most recently used file list (mru.dat), </p></li>
<li><p>additional document-related processing within <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-96CA3B4B-993F-36C0-9A5B-DF5CC74EE20E.html#GUID-E2A40307-6EB6-3ABC-B97A-63B77F565CCF"><code class="apiname">CEikonEnv::ConstructAppFromCommandLineL()</code></a>. </p></li>
</ul><p>The default document's name is read from the application's
resource file by <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-1185F595-0488-3E93-8D60-6B3A1A3AC32E.html#GUID-5D851D0B-6399-3BD8-ADB5-63AD48494D47"><code class="apiname">CEikAppUi::ProcessCommandParametersL()</code></a>. There are two ways of preventing the application from using a default
document file: </p><ul>
<li><p>Give the default document a NULL name in the resource file:</p><code class="codeph">RESOURCE TBUF { buf=""; }</code></li>
<li><p>Override <a href="GUID-251A35C1-CC66-4DE4-9EBE-964026E89E7F/GUID-1185F595-0488-3E93-8D60-6B3A1A3AC32E.html#GUID-5D851D0B-6399-3BD8-ADB5-63AD48494D47"><code class="apiname">CEikAppUi::ProcessCommandParametersL()</code></a> to zero the document name and return EFalse. This method is slightly
more efficient because it avoids reading the default document name
from the resource file altogether: </p><pre class="codeblock">TBool CMyAppUi::ProcessCommandParametersL(TApaCommand /*aCommand*/, TFileName&amp; aDocumentName, const TDesC8&amp; /*aTail*/){aDocumentName.Zero();return EFalse;}</pre></li>
</ul></div>
<div id="GUID-2DF939E2-C30C-4A84-90DC-92234BEB6AA0"><h3 class="section-title">Drive
scanning</h3><p>This can be a cause of unnecessary file server
use.   </p><p>To prevent excessive drive access and scanning, always
specify a drive letter in file paths, if known. The omission of a
drive letter will cause all available drives to be searched in the
standard Symbian platform order, in which Z: is always searched last. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-C555545B-977F-490D-A7A7-5B6D0D0AD889"><h3 class="section-title">Only
make server requests if you need to</h3><p> Server requests involve
context switching and may cause the server to run instead of the application.
In the worse case if you make a request to a server that has not yet
been started you may cause the server to start. This will involve
creating a new thread (and possibly process) and running any server
initialization code.</p></div>
<div id="GUID-1E571A30-5D8A-4647-939E-EF79B033B88E"><h3 class="section-title">Use
asynchronous server requests instead of synchronous server requests</h3><p> Synchronous operations or methods (particularly for server requests)
can cause general application slowness, and in particular, a significant
reduction in responsiveness. Synchronous requests to servers mean
your thread is waiting, so that no start-up progress is being made.
  </p><p>No 'Golden Rule' exists about when to avoid synchronous requests.
However, if an asynchronous version of a method exists, it is a good
indication that the synchronous method could potentially take some
time. Whilst it may take a little extra effort to handle asynchronous
versions of method calls, you should consider very carefully any decision
to use the synchronous version. It’s often easier to change from using
an asynchronous version to synchronous than vice versa.   </p><p>Note
that in some situations, you might know that the server is implementing
your asynchronous request synchronously. If this is the case, and
the server runs with a higher priority than your application, then
both versions of the API may have the same performance. However, using
the synchronous version in this case has the drawback that it relies
upon knowledge of the server's implementation, which could potentially
change. </p></div>
<div id="GUID-4C7697BD-2898-4E1E-AA88-41E9F3CE2603"><h3 class="section-title">Do
not repeatedly open and close connections to the same server</h3><p> Opening a connection to a server is an expensive operation. If
an application uses a server frequently then it should create one
connection and leave it open until the application is destroyed. R
classes declared as temporaries (on the stack, in other words) within
a method may be a sign of this behavior. </p></div>
