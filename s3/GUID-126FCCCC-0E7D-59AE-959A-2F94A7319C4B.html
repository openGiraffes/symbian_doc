<div id="GUID-133D5AA6-B238-4474-B6DF-C63F0451AE0E"><h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3> <p>There are several techniques for improving use of certain SQL
statements. SQLite includes some special case optimizations for the <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> and <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> aggregate functions. Where
possible, you should use UNION ALL instead of UNION. And you should
avoid using OFFSET for scrolling cursors. </p> <p><strong>Intended audience:</strong> </p> <p>This document is intended to be

<div id="GUID-4DFE36ED-1FB2-5EFF-A562-CA4C8A3B8099"><h3 class="section-title">The
MIN and MAX Optimization</h3> <p>SQLite includes some special case
optimizations for the <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> and <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> aggregate functions. The normal way of evaluating a <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> or <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> aggregate function is to run the entire
query, examine every row of the result set, and pick the largest or
smallest value. Hence, the following two queries take roughly the
same amount of work: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT x FROM demo326 WHERE y&gt;11.5;
SELECT min(x) FROM demo326 WHERE y&gt;11.5;
</pre> <p>The only difference in the above two SELECT statements
is that the first returns every possible value for “x” whereas the
second only returns the smallest. Both require about the same amount
of time to run. </p> <p>But there are some special cases where <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> and <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> are very fast. If the result
set of a SELECT consists of only the <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> function
or the <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> function and the argument to that function
is an indexed column or the RowID and there is no WHERE or HAVING
or GROUP BY clause then the query runs in logarithmic time. So these
two queries are very quick: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT min(x) FROM demo326;
SELECT max(x) FROm demo326;
</pre> <p>Note that the result set must contain a single column.
The following query is much slower: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT min(x), max(x) FROM demo326;
</pre> <p>If you need the results from this last query quickly,
you can rewrite it as follows: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT (SELECT min(x) FROM demo326), (SELECT max(x) FROM dem326);
</pre> <p>In other words, break the query up into two subqueries
both of which can be optimized using the MIN/MAX optimization. </p> <p>Note also that the result set must not be an expression on <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> or <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> - it needs to be a plain <code class="codeph">MIN()</code> or <code class="codeph">MAX()</code> and nothing else. So the
following query is slower: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT max(x)+1 FROM demo326;
</pre> <p>As before, achieve the same result quickly using a
subquery: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT (SELECT max(x) FROM demo326)+1;
</pre> </div>
<div id="GUID-1D3D05CA-4F9F-5AAF-B6D1-D8B6F250BD95"><h3 class="section-title">Use
UNION ALL in Place of UNION where Possible</h3> <p>SQLite, in accordance
with the SQL standard, allows two or more SELECT statements to be
combined using operators UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT. The
first two, UNION and UNION ALL, are the subject of this section. </p> <p>The UNION and UNION ALL operators do very nearly the same thing,
but with one important difference. Both operators return the union
of all rows from their left and right queries. The difference is that
the UNION operator removes duplicates whereas the UNION ALL operator
does not. To look it another way, the following two queries are equivalent: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT * FROM tableA UNION SELECT * FROM tableB;
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM (SELECT * FROM tableA UNION ALL SELECT * FROM tableB);
</pre> <p>When you look at it this way, you should clearly see
that UNION is just UNION ALL with some extra work to compute the DISTINCT
operation. You should also see that UNION ALL is noticeably faster
than UNION and uses less temporary storage space too. </p> <p>If you
need uniqueness of output values then by all means use UNION. It is
there for you and it works. But if you know in advance that your results
will be unique or if you do not care, UNION ALL will almost always
run faster. </p> </div>
<div id="GUID-212C03E7-CC54-5C48-AB9D-B25DC0978513"><h3 class="section-title">Avoid
Using OFFSET for Scrolling Cursors</h3> <p>A common design pattern
is to show the results of a large query result in a scrolling window.
The query result might contain hundreds or thousands of rows, but
only a handful are shown to the user at one time. The user clicks
the “Up” or “Down” buttons or drags a scrollbar to move up and down
the list. </p> <p>A common example of this is in media players where
a user has requested to see all “albums” of a particular “genre”.
There might be 200 such albums stored on the device, but the display
window is only large enough to show 5 at a time. So the first 5 albums
are displayed initially. When the user clicks the Down button the
display scrolls down to the next 5 albums. When the user presses the
Up button the display scrolls back up to the previous 5 albums. </p> <p>The naïve approach for implementing this behavior is to keep
the index of the topmost album currently displayed. When the user
presses Up or Down this index is decremented or incremented by 5 and
a query like this is run to refill the display: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT title FROM album WHERE genre='classical' ORDER BY title LIMIT 5 OFFSET ?
</pre> <p>The bound parameter on the offset field would be filled
in with the index of the topmost album to be displayed and the query
is run to generate five album titles. Presumably the album table is
indexed in such a way that both the WHERE clause and the ORDER BY
clause can be satisfied using the index so that no accumulation of
results and sorting is required. Perhaps the index looks like this: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
CREATE INDEX album_idx1 ON album(genre, title);
</pre> <p>This approach works find as long as the offset value
is small. But the time needed to evaluate this query grows linearly
with the offset. So as the user scrolls down towards the bottom of
the list, the response time for each click becomes longer and longer. </p> <p>A better approach is to remember the top and bottom title currently
being displayed. (The application probably has to do this already
in order be able to display the titles). To scroll down, run this
query: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT title FROM album WHERE genre='classical' AND title&gt;:bottom
    ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 5;
</pre> <p>And to scroll back up, use this query: </p> <pre class="codeblock">
SELECT title FROM album WHERE genre='classical' AND title&lt;:top
    ORDER BY title DESC LIMIT 5;
</pre> <p>For the scrolling down case the addition of the “title&gt;:bottom”
term (where :bottom is a parameter which is bound to the title of
the bottom element currently displayed) causes SQLite to jump immediately
to the first entry past the current display. There is no longer a
need for an OFFSET clause in the query, though we still include “LIMIT
5”. The same index will still work to optimize both the WHERE clause
and the ORDER BY clause. </p> <p>The scrolling up case is very similar,
although in this case we are looking for titles that are less than
the current top element. We have also added the “DESC” tag to the
ORDER BY clause so that titles will come out in “descending” order.
(The sort order is descending, but the order is ascending if you are
talking about the order in which the titles are displayed in the scrolling
window). As before, the same album_idx1 index is able handle both
terms of the WHERE clause and the descending ORDER BY clause. </p> <p>Both of these queries should be much faster than using OFFSET,
especially when the OFFSET is large. OFFSET is convenient for use
in ad hoc queries entered on a workstation, but it is rarely helpful
in an embedded application. An indexing scheme such as described here
is only slightly more complex to implement but is much faster from
user's perspective. </p> </div>
